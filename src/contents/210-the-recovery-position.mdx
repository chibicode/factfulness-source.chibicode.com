Before the 1950s, war surgery guidelines didn't have a specific body position recommended for the care of trauma patients. When the so-called NATO coma position had been successfully used by the US in the Korean War, however, it began to be promoted for saving unconscious soldiers; see Högberg and Bergström (1997). The recovery position was not standardized until decades later, in the early 1990s, when it emerged in general first aid handbooks. See [Wikipedia[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_position) for more on the history of the recovery position.
