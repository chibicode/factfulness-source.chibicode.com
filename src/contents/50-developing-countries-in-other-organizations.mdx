Large parts of the UN still use the term "developing countries", but there is no common definition. The UN Statistics Division (2017) uses it for so-called "statistical convenience", finding it convenient to classify as many as 144 countries as developing (including Qatar and Singapore, two of the healthiest and richest countries on the planet). The World Economic Forum re-posted the World Bank announcement of phasing out the division in "developed" and "developing", but continues to use the term. From only a few years back the term appears in several headlines on their website: "84% of refugees live in developing countries" (June 20, 2017), "5 ways to make global trade work for developing countries" (September, 2016), and "Digital can lift the developing world out of poverty" (July 10, 2017). This illustrates one aspect of the problematic definitions. In the first article, the number is taken from a report issued by UNHCR where "developing countries" refers to the outdated list of the UN Statistics Division. In the second and third, "developing countries" and "developing world" actually refer to theÂ [UN list of Least Developed Countries](https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category.html), which is updated every third year, taking into account per capita income, human assets and economic vulnerability.
