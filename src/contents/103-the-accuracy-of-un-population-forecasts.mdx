UN Population forecasts are based on UN-Pop[1,2,5]; see below for the UN Population data. Like forecasting the weather, it is almost impossible to perfectly predict the future population. But the demography experts at the UN Population Division have been very accurate in their forecasts for many decades, even before modern computer modeling was possible. Their forecasts of the future number of children have stayed the same in the past four revisions of the publication. The official UN projection is alternative C. 2 billion children is a rounded number. The precise UN numbers are 1.95 billion as of 2017 and 1.97 billion for 2100.

[The Accuracy of Past Projections](http://www.gapm.io/xbonpop) is a study from Bongaarts and Bulato (2000) that measure past projections, and find that the average error of UN world population forecasts are modest, at 2.8%, for an average length of projection of 17 years (see, for example, p. 50). Also Keilman (2001) studied the quality of UN population projections, and analyzed forecasts prepared by the UN between 1950 to 1993. For a video of Hans Rosling comparing these historic forecast based on Keilman's study, see: [How Reliable is the World Population Forecast?](http://www.gapm.io/mmpopfut) The projections are available at the [UN website](http://www.esa.un.org/unpd/wpp), as well as the [uncertainty intervals of their medium forecasts](about:blank).
