      The passage draws on World Bank[26], ODI, PRIO, Paul Collier's The Bottom
      Billion (2007), and the BBC documentary
      <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-end-poverty/">
        &quot;Don't Panic---End Poverty&quot;
      </a>
      from Gapminder[11].
    </p>
    <p>
      While extreme poverty has fallen, the number of extremely poor people
      living in conflict has been stable or even increased, based on preliminary
      data from PRIO. If current wars continue, the vast majority of extremely
      poor children will soon live behind military lines. This poses a cultural
      challenge to the international aid community. The International Dialogue
      on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding had its fifth global meeting in
      Stockholm, 2016. The meeting, following the Stockholm Declaration against
      war and conflict, discussed how the aid community is now
      <a href="https://www.pbsbdialogue.org/en">
        preparing for the risk of extreme poverty in conflict prone countries
      </a>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      The other risks are not ongoing. Extreme poverty is. 78% are small scale
      farmers in extremely poor areas. In extreme poverty, every second person
      is a child, see <a href="http://econ.worldbank.org/">World Bank[26]</a>,
      they are from ethnic minorities; see ODI. While the global rate of poor
      has fallen, the number of poor in conflict has been stable or even
      increased, based on preliminary data from PRIO. One can only speculate
      about the future, but if the current wars continue, soon a vast majority
      of all these children will need to be helped behind a military defend
      line. This poses a cultural challenge to the international aid community,
      as Collier describes in The Bottom Million.

        Conflicts in Afghanistan and central Africa mean that all other
        sustainability projects in those places are on hold.

        When rhinos are stuck in the middle of a civil war, it's much more
        difficult to save them.
      </li>
      <li>
        There's no innovation needed to end poverty. The quicker we act, the
        smaller the problem (as people in extreme poverty have large families
        and their numbers keep increasing. )
      </li>
      <li>
        The hardest to help will be those stuck behind violent and chaotic armed
        gangs in weakly governed states.
      </li>
      <li>
        To escape poverty, they will need a stabilizing military presence of
        some kind. They will need police officers with guns and government
        authority to defend innocent citizens against violence and to allow
        teachers to educate the next generation in peace.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For a longer list of major risks, see Global Catastrophes and Trends: The
      Next Fifty Years by Smil (2008). For those who find numbers calming, this
      is where you will find the big picture of the proportional risks and
      uncertainties of all kinds of possible fatal discontinuities.
