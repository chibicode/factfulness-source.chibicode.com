    United Kingdom probably had among the world's longest lives in 1800, on
    average 36 years according to Livi-Bacci (1989), A Concise History of World
    Population. Swedes and almost everyone else lived to 32 years or less; see 
    <a href="http://gapm.io/ilex">Gapminder[4]</a>. British children began to
    work at an early age, on average at 10, which varied between regions. Young
    children were extremely valuable in British coal mines because they were
    small. Until 1842, many children, some as young as five years old, died
    while working their 10 hour shifts as trappers. For more on child labor in
    industrial England, see
