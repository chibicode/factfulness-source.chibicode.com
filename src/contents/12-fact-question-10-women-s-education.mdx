Correct answer is A. Worldwide, women aged 25 to 34 have an average of 9.09 years of schooling, and men have 10.21, according to [IHME[2]](http://www.healthdata.org/node/3680) estimates from 188 countries. Women aged 25 to 29 have an average of 8.79 years of schooling, and men 9.32 years, according to [Barro and Lee](http://www.barrolee.com/) (2013) estimates from 146 countries in 2010. As always, there is uncertainty in these kinds of estimates, but there is no reason to assume that the difference between genders is nearly as large as what people think. Gapminder first asked this question with an open answer field to see how responses were distributed, before deciding on three exact values for alternatives A, B and C, in order to make the skewed perception easier to compare to random results.
