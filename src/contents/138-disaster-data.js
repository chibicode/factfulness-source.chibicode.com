    The International Disasters Database (see CRED) estimates that the
    earthquake in Nepal 2015 killed 9,034, injured 200,000 and affected 5.6
    million people. The government of Nepal estimates a slightly higher death
    toll of 10,000 deaths; see PDNA. To avoid underestimating the suffering, we
    have used the higher number from PDNA. Numbers for the 2003 heat wave in
    Europe are from UNISDR, estimating the total death toll for Western Europe
    to be 46,730 fatalities. All other disaster data used here comes from
    EM-DAT. Nowadays, Bangladesh has a very advanced flood-monitoring website;
