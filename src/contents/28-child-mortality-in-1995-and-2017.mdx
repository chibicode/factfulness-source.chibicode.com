Child mortality data used in the 1995 lecture came from UNICEF[1]. In this book we have updated the examples, using 2017 estimations from [UN-IGME](http://www.childmortality.org/)---a data collaboration between UNICEF, WHO, UN Population Division and the World Bank. The numbers used in the evening lecture back in 1995 were only slightly different: Saudi Arabia in 1960 was 292 and in 1993, 38; Malaysia in 1960 was 105 and in 1993, 17; Brazil in 1960 was 181 and in 1993, 63; Tanzania in 1960 was 249 and in 1993, 16.

The data from UNICEF[1] is based on The State of the World's Children 1995, published by Oxford U P, available to download as [PDF here](https://www.unicef.org/about/history/files/sowc_1995.pdf). Data for 2017 is derived from "Child Mortality Estimates" from [www.childmortality.org](http://www.childmortality.org/). UN-IGME---United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation---is a data collaboration between UNICEF, WHO, UN Population Division and the World Bank.
