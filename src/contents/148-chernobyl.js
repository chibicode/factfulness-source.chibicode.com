      In 2016, the World Health Organization published &quot;1986-2016:
      Chernobyl at 30 -- an update&quot; and they report that they couldn't
      confirm any large increase in cancers, like thyroid cancer, that many had
      expected in the population in general. Instead, they conclude: &quot;The
      psycho-social impact of disasters and emergencies has been well
      documented. It has been reported to be the Chernobyl accident main public
      health impact that affected the largest number of people. A similar effect
      is now reported in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, &quot;
      reporting that &quot;anxiety levels that were twice as high than
      non-exposed population, and were more likely to report multiple
      unexplained physical symptoms and subjective poor health.&quot; Read more
