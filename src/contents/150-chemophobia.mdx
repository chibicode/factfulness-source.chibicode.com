Gordon Gribble (2013) tracks the origin of chemophobia back to the publication of Silent Spring (1962) by Rachel Carson, and chemical accidents in the decades that followed. He argues that the exaggerated and irrational fear of chemicals today leads to wrong usage of common resources. According to Gribble, "Regulatory authorities should focus not on pesticides, antibiotics and dioxins, but rather on pathogens, bacteria and fungi, which cause millions of cases of food-borne infections that result in hospitalization or death each year."
