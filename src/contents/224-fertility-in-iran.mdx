Professor Hossein Malek-Afzali at Tehran University of Medical Science was Hans's host in Iran, who showed him the infertility clinic and taught him about Iran's family planning and sexual education programs. We use the term "babies per woman" for the statistical indicator "total fertility rate." In 1997, the full drop in fertility rate had not yet been achieved. Still, in the data that Hans had back then, Iran had the fastest drop. Today's UN data rather put Oman as the fastest with Gapminder data compared. (Except for Oman, depending on which years you compare, and how you deal with Gapminder's estimates of temporary dips. When removing those (by 5 year averages) the lead table looks like the following: Drop size within any time frame: Armenia: 4.06; Iran: 3.47; China: 3.46; Oman: 3.45; North Korea: 3.34; Russia: 3.11; Cuba: 2.45.

These improvements in Iran, especially for women, also reflect achievements in regards to health and education. Women in Iran today have an average 10 years of school, compared to 2 years in 1970, according to HME[2]. During the same years, life expectancy increased from 56 years to 76 during the same period, based on HME[2]. Comparing these numbers back then with Iran today, the differences are as wide as they probably could be. In Afghanistan, women today have 1 year of school, which is half of Iran's level in 1970. At present, Iran has a lower fertility rate than the US and Sweden. As of 2017, the total fertility rate is estimated to be at 1.636 in Iran; 1.876 in the US; and 1.909 in Sweden, based on total fertility (TFR) data from UN's [World Population Prospects 2017](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/).  To compare Iran---the world champion in family planning---against other countries over time, see [www.gapm.io/vm2](http://www.gapm.io/vm2).
