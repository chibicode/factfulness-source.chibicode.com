During the past ten years, "the external environment is volatile, with capital markets increasingly characterized by more extreme events", observe Dobbs et al. in No Ordinary Disruption (2016), illustrated by the peaks in the trend line on page 88. In his article "How Should We Prevent the Next Financial Crisis?" (2015) Ricardo Hausmann suggests that since the financial system constantly changes, it is difficult to learn from past mistakes---our next financial crisis will simply not look like any other that has happened before. Many countries have regulated their financial systems to prevent future crises by restricting loans and risk-taking. While this strategy is good for some countries, preventative measures do not benefit all. A number of countries in Latin America for example, Hausmann writes, have instead made their economies too secure.
