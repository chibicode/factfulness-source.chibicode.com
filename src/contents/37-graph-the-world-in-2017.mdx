Each circle, or bubble, represents a country. The area of the circle is proportional to the population of the country, using data from [UN-POP[1]](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp). On the x-axis is the total fertility rate, using data from [UN-POP[3]](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp). The scale is reversed, putting large families to the left and small to the right. This is to show progress as a movement from left to right, which is more intuitive. The y-axis shows the child survival rate in percent. These numbers are more commonly expressed as the child mortality rate in deaths before 5 years of age, per 1,000 live births. We changed the rate to percent, because it is more broadly understood, and we also show survival instead of mortality so that the positive direction is upward, which intuitively is more positive. The [UN-IGME data](http://www.childmortality.org/) for the child mortality rate ends in 2016. [Gapminder[6] ](http://gapm.io/du5mr)extended the series by using the percentage change expected by UN WPP 2017 medium fertility variant from [World Population Prospects 2017](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Download/Standard/Interpolated/).

The two boxes are not showing any official thresholds. They are there for comparison with the world in 1965. In 2017, only 13 countries with 6.4 percent of the world population are still in the "developing" box. Those are as follows: Angola, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Chad, DR Congo, East Timor, Gambia, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Somalia and Uganda. 37 countries with 8.4% of the world population are between the boxes. 134 countries are in the "developed" box.
