Putting countries into two groups as being a "democracy" or not is highly problematic. We use Max Roser's data as compiled at [OurWorldInData[4]](https://ourworldindata.org/democracy). Roser has adopted the definitions of the [Polity IV dataset](http://www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm) but give the numbers in terms of inhabitants, not number of countries. The Polity IV dataset puts countries on a democracy scale, and defines non-democratic regimes as autocracies (e.g. China), closed anocracy (e.g. Morocco), open anocracy (e.g. Russia) or colonial regimes. In this graph, we only show democracies, hence disregarding all types of non-democratic regimes. For an alternate detailed list of development of democracy, see Mathew White's ["Chronological List of Democracies"](http://www.bookofhorriblethings.com/historyofdemocracy/History-of-Democracy-APX-list.html).
