We use the term "babies per woman" for the statistical indicator "total fertility rate" (TFR). Fertility rates decline during times of hardship. The dips and humps before 1965 shown on the graph were caused by the Second World War and famines. Fertility climbs to rates higher than usual when the crisis is over. Globally, the average fertility rate was at 5.05 children in 1950, according to UN-Pop[3]. As of 2017, the estimated fertility rate was 2.48 children, according to UN-Pop. Replacement rate with the current mortality worldwide is 2.3.

The long trend displayed on the graph shows Mattias Lindgren's work that compiled multiple historical sources for the years before 1950. It is aligned with UN-Pop[3] estimates for post-1950; see [Gapminder[7]](http://gapm.io/dtfr). The dashed line after 2017 shows the UN-Pop[1] medium fertility projection, which is expected to reach 1.96 in 2099.

For more about famines before 1965, see, for example, the [Great Chinese Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine), "the single biggest famine event in history in terms of absolute numbers of death" on Wikipedia. The most accurate number is probably estimated at 40 million people who died during the Chinese famine; see [necrometrics](http://www.necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao) for a documentation of sources. The age structure of the Chinese population still bear marks of [fewer number of children born during the famine](https://www.gapminder.org/geo/china).
