      Life expectancy suffered an extreme dip in Bangladesh 1971 because of the
      Bangladesh war of independence. In 1972, the total fertility rate was 6.93
      children per woman and life expectancy was 47 years according to UN, or 52
      years according to IHME. In Bangladesh today, the total fertility rate is
      2.07 children per woman and life expectancy is 72.8 years according to UN,
      or 72.7 according to IHME. Since 1972, the under-five mortality rate per
      1,000 live births (U5mr) has reduced significantly. It fell from 221.7
      children in 1972 to 34.2 in 2016. In other words, the child survival rate
      in 1972 was 778 surviving children per 1,000 which means 77.8 percent.
      Today, the number is 966 out of 1,000 which means that 96.6 percent of
      children in Bangladesh survive. The child mortality rate was 313 children
      per 1,000 live births in Egypt 1960. Child mortality rates in Egypt and
      Bangladesh are based on data from 
      <a href="http://www.gapm.io/xu5mr">UN-IGME</a>. At 
      <a href="http://www.gapm.io/du5mr">www.gapm.io/du5mr</a> we describe in
      full how we have combined child mortality data from multiple sources.
