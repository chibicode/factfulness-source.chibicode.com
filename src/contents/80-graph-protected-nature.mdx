This trend is based on [UNEP[5]](https://protectedplanet.net/)  which keeps track of protected areas as defined by IUCN[1,2] (International Union for Conservation of Nature). The trend after 1990 is based on the figure on page 30 in [UNEP[6]](http://gapm.io/xprotp16). Between 1911 and 1990 the trend comes from Abouchakra et al (2016), which is based on UNEP[5] data from february 2012. Between 1900 and 1911 the data was aggregated from the historic records in UNEP[5] by [Gapminder[31].](http://gapm.io/protnat) To see The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA), visit [www.protectedplanet.net](http://www.protectedplanet.net/).
