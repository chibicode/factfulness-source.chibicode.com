      現在、ILO(国際労働機関)による児童労働の定義は、 The current ILO
      (International Labour Organization) definition of "child labor" excludes
      light part-time work, and includes only the so called "worst forms of
      child labour"; see
      <H.A href="http://gapm.io/xilo182">ILO[6]</H.A>.
      <H.A href="about:blank">Gapminder[42]</H.A> combines data from three
      different ILO reports, using three age intervals; ILO[
      <H.A href="http://gapm.io/xiloi">7</H.A>,
      <H.A href="http://gapm.io/xiloipe">8</H.A>,
      <H.A href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor">9</H.A>]. The actual
      degree of child labor is uncertain, but the trend of decline is evident in
      all sources measured consistently over time. Data from
      <H.A href="http://gapm.io/xiloipe">ILO[8] </H.A>covers the years
      2000--2012. It overlaps in time with{' '}
      <H.A href="http://gapm.io/xiloi">ILO[7]</H.A> but reports data for a wider
      age-interval spanning the years 5--17 years. The overlapping years in
      ILO[8] were used to align with ILO[7]. The ILO[9] data is from the ILO
      Programme on Estimates and Projections on the Elimination of Child Labour
      and covers the period 1950--1995. The age interval reported here is 10--14
      years. For 1950, 27.6 percent is the estimate of children were involved in
      child labor. This is probably a low estimate, considering that a majority
      of children didn't go to school in the 1950s--- only one third did in
      China and India, according to
      <H.A href="http://gapm.io/xbl17">Barro-Lee</H.A>. We don't know if these
      children out of school were used for labor under bad conditions, so we
      decided to use this official ILO estimate, even though it reports on an
      older age group. While the global decline of child labor is certain, the
      actual levels at all times are not. Since writing this book, new numbers
      supporting our general estimates have been published on
      <H.A href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor">OurWorldInData[3]</H.A>
