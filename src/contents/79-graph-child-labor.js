      The current ILO (International Labour Organization) definition of
      &quot;child labor&quot; excludes light part-time work, and includes only
      the so called &quot;worst forms of child labour&quot;; see 
      <a href="http://gapm.io/xilo182">ILO[6]</a>. 
      <a href="about:blank">Gapminder[42]</a> combines data from three different
      ILO reports, using three age intervals; ILO[
      <a href="http://gapm.io/xiloi">7</a>,
      <a href="http://gapm.io/xiloipe">8</a>,
      <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor">9</a>]. The actual degree
      of child labor is uncertain, but the trend of decline is evident in all
      sources measured consistently over time. Data from 
      <a href="http://gapm.io/xiloipe">ILO[8] </a>covers the years 2000--2012.
      It overlaps in time with <a href="http://gapm.io/xiloi">ILO[7]</a> but
      reports data for a wider age-interval spanning the years 5--17 years. The
      overlapping years in ILO[8] were used to align with ILO[7]. The ILO[9]
      data is from the ILO Programme on Estimates and Projections on the
      Elimination of Child Labour and covers the period 1950--1995. The age
      interval reported here is 10--14 years. For 1950, 27.6 percent is the
      estimate of children were involved in child labor. This is probably a low
      estimate, considering that a majority of children didn't go to school in
      the 1950s--- only one third did in China and India, according to 
      <a href="http://gapm.io/xbl17">Barro-Lee</a>. We don't know if these
      children out of school were used for labor under bad conditions, so we
      decided to use this official ILO estimate, even though it reports on an
      older age group. While the global decline of child labor is certain, the
      actual levels at all times are not. Since writing this book, new numbers
      supporting our general estimates have been published on 
      <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor">OurWorldInData[3]</a>.
