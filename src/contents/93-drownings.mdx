The data on drownings today comes from IHME[4,5]: see [www.hmeuw.org/49kq](http://www.hmeuw.org/49kq) and [www.ihmeuw.org/49ks](http://www.ihmeuw.org/49ks) respectively. Up until 1900, more than 20 percent of the victims of drownings were children below the age of ten. The Swedish Life Saving Society started lobbying for obligatory swimming practice in all schools, which together with other preventive actions reduced the number; see Sundin et al. (2005).
