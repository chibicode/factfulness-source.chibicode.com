    Annual deaths from natural disasters have decreased by 75 percent over the
    past 100 years, according to the International Disaster Database; see
    <H.A href="http://www.emdat.be/">EM-DAT</H.A>. Since disasters vary from
    year to year, here we compare ten-year averages. In chapter four where we
    further discuss the decline, we also use 25-year averages. In the last ten
    years (2007--2016), on average 80,386 people were killed by natural
    disasters per year. This is 25 percent of the number 100 years earlier
    (1907--1916), when it was 325,742 deaths per year. The huge decline in
    disaster deaths would be even more striking if two other major global
    changes are taken into account. First that the world's population has
    increased by four, which calls for counting disaster deaths per capita. In
    1907--1916 there were 181 disaster deaths per million people. In 2007--2016
    the number was 11. The relative number has dropped to 6 percent of what it
    was 100 years ago. Second, 100 years ago the communication technologies for
    reporting disasters and their victims were very primitive, compared to the
    monitoring of today. Many catastrophes must have gone unrecorded ur been
    underreported. The EM-DAT data include death toll estimates for 8969
    disasters recorded worldwide since 1900, including all known emergency
    events categorized as: Animal accident, Complex Disasters, Drought,
    Earthquake, Epidemic, Extreme temperature, Flood, Fog, Impact, Insect
    infestation, Landslide, Mass movement (dry), Storm, Volcanic activity,
    Wildfire.
