Correct answer is C. The UN experts (i.e. the demographers of the UN Population Division) publish new official population forecasts every second year in their publication World Population Prospect. They work with multiple alternative scenarios. The one they think is most probable is called the 'medium fertility variant', which falls between the highest and lowest predictions of fertility and mortality decline worldwide. For the past ten years, the UN Population Division has published forecasts of this scenario predicting that the number of children in the year 2100 will not be higher than it is today. In their latest revision published in 2017, the UN Population Division estimates that there are 1.975 billion children (aged 0 to 14) in 2017 and forecast that the number will be 1.957 billion in 2100 (having peaked at 2.094 in the year 2057); see[ UN-Pop[2]](http://www.esa.un.org/unpd/wpp). Nobody can know for sure, but the question is only asking which forecast is the most likely. See [www.gapm.io/q5](http://www.gapm.io/q5).
