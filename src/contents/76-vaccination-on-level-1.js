    In Afghanistan in 2016, more than 60 percent of the 1-year olds have
    received most of the vaccines as listed byÂ 
    <a href="http://gapm.io/xwhoim">WHO[1]</a>: BCG (Tuberculosis): 74 percent,
    DTP3 (Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis): 65 percent, HepB3 (Hepatitis
    B): 65 percent, Hib3 (Haemophilus influenzae type b): 65 percent, MCV1
    (Measles, 1st dose): 62 percent, PAB (Neonatal tetanus): 65 percent, PCV3
    (Pneumococcal conjugate): 65 percent and Pol3 (Polio): 60 percent. Only MCV2
    (the second shot against measles which brings immunity from 95 to 99.99
    percent) is lower, at 39 percent, which is the case in many countries on
    Level 1. None of these vaccines existed when Sweden was on Level 1 or 2,
    which is part of the reason lives were shorter in Sweden back then.
