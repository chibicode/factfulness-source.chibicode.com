    Gapminder has asked the public in the United States and Sweden how they
    imagine life in &quot;low-income countries&quot; or &quot;developing
    countries.&quot; They systematically guessed numbers that would have been
    correct 30 or 40 years ago. On average, respondents believed life expectancy
    is roughly 45 years, while <a href="http://gapm.io/xwb177">World Bank[7]</a>
     says 62 years. They believed that roughly 20 percent of people in
    low-income countries have access to an improved water source---the correct
    number, according to <a href="http://gapm.io/xwb178">World Bank[8]</a>, is
    66 percent. Further, they believed 40 percent of children are
    vaccinated---but data says 78 percent; see
    <a href="http://gapm.io/xwb179">World Bank[9]</a> based on
    <a href="http://gapm.io/xwhoim">WHO[1]</a>. They believed roughly 70 percent
    are undernourished but it is only 26 percent; see
    <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/tb/">World Bank[10]</a> based on
    <a href="http://gapm.io/faoh2006">FAO[1]</a>. All data from low-income
    countries have large uncertainties; still, the uncertainties are smaller
    than the public's misconceptions. See
