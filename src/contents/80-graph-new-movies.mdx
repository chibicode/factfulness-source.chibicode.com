The Internet Movie Database ([IMBd](https://www.imdb.com/)) is maintained by film enthusiasts across the world, and has a nearly complete coverage of all feature films, making 3.5 million movies searchable and filterable by year. Many early cinematic recordings were done in the last years of the 19th century, but they dare often experimental and short we don't consider them feature films. We have chosen 1906 as the year of the first feature, referring to "The Story of the Kelly Gang", a 70 minute long narrative film; seeÂ [Wikipedia[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film#History).
