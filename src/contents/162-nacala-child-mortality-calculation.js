    The births and population data used for these calculations is based on the
    Mozambique census of 1970, the Nacala hospital's own records, and UN-IGME of
    2017. The deaths in the hospital are based on Hans's own notes. The official
    child mortality estimate for the whole country was probably different back
    then. For this calculation example, we use the latest available estimate for
    that year from <a href="http://www.childmortality.org/">UN-IGME</a> of 2017.
    Mozambique was the poorest country in the world in 1979, according to the
    World Bank's latest available estimates; see 
    <a href="https://www.gapminder.org/whc">www.gapminder.org/whc</a>. According
    to <a href="http://gapm.io/xwhowf">WHO[8]</a>, the number of doctors per
    100,000 people in 1980 was 2.2 in Sweden, and 0.0255 in Mozambique. After
    the liberation in Mozambique, extremely few doctors remained in the remote
    districts; see World Bank[24].
