        すべての問題の責任を温暖化というひとつの原因になすりつけるのは悪い癖で、これが「温暖化責任論」と呼ばれるものだ。ただし、地球温暖化を否定しても問題は解決できない。これまでも歴史の中で人々が新しい環境に適応してきた多くの事例を念頭に置きながら、これから人間が温暖化とどのように共生していくかを現実的に予測したほうがいい。

      Climate change is among other problems, and it is there are many examples
      in world history of humans adapting to new circumstances.

      The idea of climate change as a single scenario is refuted by Smil (2008).
      In his book Global Catastrophes and Trends, Smil uses global warming as a
      good example of a process that is too complex to happen as a single event.
      An assumption that is questioned by Johan Rockström and others who insist
      that this line of thinking may be a case of the straight line instinct.
      Smil argues that climate change will probably not lead to a catastrophic
      event destroying everything at ones, but neither will it be a slow
      transition that we won't notice. The future effects of climate change will
      have aspect of both fast and gradual transition. Fascinating examples of
      pivotal moments in human history, in regards to food and energy
      consumption, is also given by Ruth DeFries (2014). In The Big Ratchet,
      DeFries convincingly shows how the current human-produced system is
      unsustainable, with fertilizers and depletion of natural resources,
      without claiming that this must necessarily lead to a sudden catastrophic
      event.
