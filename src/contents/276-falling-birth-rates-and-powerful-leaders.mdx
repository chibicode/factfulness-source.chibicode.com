The Chinese population was 0.55 billion in 1949 and increased by another 0.7 billion 1949--1976. From 1970 to 1976, the total fertility rate declined by half---when Deng Xiaoping enacted China's one child policy in 1979, population growth was already on the fall.

Data about the population of China is derived from UN-Pop[1] and Sheng Luo (1988), which reconstructed population trends in China by year.
