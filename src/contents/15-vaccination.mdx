Vaccination data comes from [WHO[1]](http://gapm.io/xwhoim). Even in Afghanistan, more than 60 percent of the one-year-olds today have received multiple vaccinations. None of these vaccines existed when Sweden was on Level 1 or 2, which is part of the reason lives were shorter in Sweden back then. See [www.gapm.io/tvac](http://www.gapm.io/tvac).
