The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List[4] now includes an impressive 87,967 wildlife lkölspecies (animals, fungi and plants), each with an expert assessments of threat-status. Out of these, 25,062 (approximately 28%) today fall within one of the the three "threatened" categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), or Vulnerable (VU). Despite the fact that the status of many of these species is not improving, we consider it a great improvement that they are at least monitored. Data after 2000 come from Red List[4]. The estimates for the following years are handpicked from the following publications and pages: 1986, 1990 and 1996 come from previous paper editions of the list: [Page iv, Red List 1986 edition](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-1986-001.pdf); [Page ix, Red List 1990 edition](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-1990-001.pdf); and [page 4, Red List 1996 edition](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/RL-1996-001.pdf). The first systematic approach to register and monitor threatened species was the 1959 "Threatened Mammals Card Index". It compiled data about 34 mammal species and was managed by The Species Survival Commission under Leofric Boyle, [according to the about page at Red List](http://support.iucnredlist.org/about).
