The main causes of deaths have been the same throughout human history: bacteria, viruses, starvation, and violence. The common lethal bacterias probably killed people at a constant rate until modern sanitation was invented. Roughly 1% of childbirths resulted in the death of the mother, due to complications or infections. As women gave birth to an average of 6 children, this means that at least 6% of women died giving birth; see Livi-Bacci[1], Paine & Boldsen[1], and Gapminder[25]. Of these newborns, somewhere between 30% and 50% died before age 1, and another 10% before age 5; see Lewis[1]. Most children died from diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, malaria, or some bacterial infection. The 60% who survived childhood, died before completing parenthood. The general risk of interpersonal violence and accidents were constantly higher, but the other main killers---violence, pandemics and starvation---killed at rates that varied enormously between years and places. During most years, there was probably enough food, it was peace and people were somewhat healthy. But then, every 50 years came some pandemic of cholera, smallpox, measles or malaria, a bad harvest, or a war, killing 10% or more of those who had survived childhood; see Paine and Boldsen (p. 176).
