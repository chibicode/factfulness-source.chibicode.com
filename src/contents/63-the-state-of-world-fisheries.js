      Fishing vessels are becoming larger and can go out further into the deep
      seas to find the remaining stocks of fish. In their report The State of
      World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2016, FAO[2] conducted an analysis of
      assessed commercial fish stocks. The study showed that the share of fish
      stocks within biologically sustainable levels decreased from 90 percent in
      1974, to 68.6 percent in 2013.

      In The Plundered Planet (2010), Collier shows how the real price of a
      natural resource is calculated---the use by one generation of humans,
      based on the reproduction rate of the resource. This is a way of
      determining how much fish each generation can consume.

      UNEP[1] reports more than 500 recorded dead zones in polluted coastal
      areas around the world. According to

      threatened species in 2015 was 23,250 and increased to 24,307 in 2016.
