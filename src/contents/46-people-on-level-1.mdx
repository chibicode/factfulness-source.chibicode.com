Approximately 0.75 billion people live on Level 1 with less than $2 per day, according toÂ [Gapminder[8]](http://gapm.io/incm). The threshold of $2 per day is almost identical to the World Bank's $1.9 per day. Gapminder rounded that up to $2 per day to make it easier to remember, and to avoid the false precision in poverty estimates that are very rough.
