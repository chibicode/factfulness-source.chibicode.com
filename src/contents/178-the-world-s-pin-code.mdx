These maps show the official UN forecasts, rounded to billions, from the [2017 Revision of World Population Prospects](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/) from UN-Pop[1]. The world population was 7.55 billion in 2017 according to their estimates. That would usually be rounded to 8 billion, but we show 7 billion because we are rounding the population region by region. The populations of the [four Gapminder regions](http://gapm.io/ireg)were estimated based on national data: the Americas, 1.0 billion; Europe, 0.84 billion; Africa, 1.3 billion; and Asia, 4.4 billion.
