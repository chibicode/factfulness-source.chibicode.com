In "Explaining Fertility Transitions" (1997), Karen Oppenheim Mason discusses changing family norms. Of course there are many differences between cultures and how fast their values change when families change to a modern lifestyle with more resources. Europe never had such oppressive traditions against women like for example the foot bindings of East Asia.

Karen Oppenheim Mason discusses the changing family norms in her cross-disciplinary article "Explaining Fertility Transitions". The strength of cultural differences is easily overstated though. Gender roles change quite fast in all cultures as people get richer and their way of living is modernized. In cultures with an emphasis on extended families, values may change a bit more slowly.
