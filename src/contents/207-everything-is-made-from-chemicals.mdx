People with chemophobia divide the world into "natural" (safe) and "chemical" (industrial and harmful). The world's largest database of defined chemical compounds sees it differently. CAS contains 132 million organic and synthetic chemicals and their properties. It shows that toxicity is not related to who produces the compound. Cobratoxin (CAS registry number 12584-83-7), for example, which is produced by nature, paralyzes your nervous system until you can't breathe; see [Del Brutto (2012)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobratoxin#cite_note-pmid21999367-8) retrieved via Wikipedia[8].
