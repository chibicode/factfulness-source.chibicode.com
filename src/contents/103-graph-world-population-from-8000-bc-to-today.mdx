The graph showing the world population from 8000 bc to today uses data from hundreds of dif­ferent sources, compiled by the economic historian Mattias Lindgren. The sources listed under the chart are only the main sources. The next billion were added to the world population in 130 years after 1800:

| Year | Estimate |
| 1800 | 946,764,816 |
| 1812 | 1,000,325,622 |
| 1929 | 2,017,045,912 |

UN Population Division prepared historic world population estimates that can be found online in the UN publication, [The World at Six Billion](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbillion.htm). For estimates beginning in year zero, see Table 1, page 5, available to download [as PDF](http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf). Caldwell and Schindlmayr (2002) provides population estimates before 1950 in [Historical Population Estimates: Unraveling the Consensus](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3092809) published in the Population and Development Review (pp. 183--204).
