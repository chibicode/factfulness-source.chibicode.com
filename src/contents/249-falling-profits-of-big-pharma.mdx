In [a study published in Health Affairs](https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1029), Berndt et al. (2015) analyzed the falling profits of Big Pharma, concluding that: "If this level of diminished returns persists, we believe that the rewards for innovation will not be sufficient for pharmaceutical manufacturers to maintain the historical rates of investments needed to sustain biomedical innovation." Forbes (2016) refers to this study, discussing the presumed end of the so-called [Golden Era of pharmaceutical profits](https://www.forbes.com/sites/peterubel/2016/07/29/is-the-golden-era-of-pharmaceutical-profits-over/#9e5d4937207b).
