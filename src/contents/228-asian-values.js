      In &quot;Explaining Fertility Transitions&quot; (1997), Karen Oppenheim
      Mason discusses changing family norms. Of course there are many
      differences between cultures and how fast their values change when
      families change to a modern lifestyle with more resources. Europe never
      had such oppressive traditions against women like for example the foot
      bindings of East Asia.

      Karen Oppenheim Mason discusses the changing family norms in her
      cross-disciplinary article &quot;Explaining Fertility Transitions&quot;.
      The strength of cultural differences is easily overstated though. Gender
      roles change quite fast in all cultures as people get richer and their way
      of living is modernized. In cultures with an emphasis on extended
      families, values may change a bit more slowly. SeeÂ
