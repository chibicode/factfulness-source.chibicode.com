      The number of warheads peaked in the mid 1980s and has steadily decreased
      since. SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) estimates
      the total number in 2017 at 14,935---see
      <H.A href="http://www.gapm.io/xsipri17">www.gapm.io/xsipri17</H.A>. The
      Nuclear Notebook gives a detailed breakdown: "As of mid-2017, we estimate
      that there are nearly 15,000 nuclear weapons located at some 107 sites in
      14 countries. Roughly, 9,400 of these weapons are in military arsenals;
      the remaining weapons are retired and awaiting dismantlement.
      Approximately 4,150 are operationally available, and some 1,800 are on
      high alert and ready for use on short notice. By far, the largest
      concentrations of nuclear weapons reside in Russia and the United States,
      which possess 93 percent of the total global inventory." The Nuclear
      Notebook can be found at
