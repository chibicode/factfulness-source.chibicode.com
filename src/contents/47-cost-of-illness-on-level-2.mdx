Life is uncertain on Level 1 and 2. Many (maybe half) of those leaving the extreme poverty of Level 1 fall back again within a year or two. In his great book [One Illness Away: Why People Become Poor and How They Escape Poverty](http://www.amazon.in/One-Illness-Away-People-Poverty/dp/0199693196) (2010), [Anirudh Krishna](https://sanford.duke.edu/people/faculty/krishna-anirudh) describes the effect of disease on poor families who are making progress. Illness often forces them back into destitute, since they have no safety nets or health insurances whatsoever. Level 2 roughly corresponds to the World Bank income group called "Lower middle income", where people pay on average 55 percent of their health expenditure with cash, see [World Bank[11]](http://gapm.io/xwb1711).

[Voices of the Poor](http://gapm.io/xwb1712) is a three volume publication from the World Bank[12] of interviews with poor people across 47 countries. Many describe the unfortunate events of illness that lead them back into extreme poverty again soon after escaping.
