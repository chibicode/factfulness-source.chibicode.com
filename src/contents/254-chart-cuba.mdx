Hans was showing child survival rates on his bubble charts back then. We later decided to show life expectancy so that people wouldn't think we were focusing only on children. Life expectancy and child survival go hand in hand.

The charts hide a few richer countries to save space to the right, and the most unhealthy countries, at the bottom.

Next to Cuba, the new data puts Costa Rica and Panama on the same income, but with higher life expectancy. That wasn't the case when Hans was showing the graph in Cuba. The Cuban experience is described at greater length in Hans's memoirs; see Rosling[8].
