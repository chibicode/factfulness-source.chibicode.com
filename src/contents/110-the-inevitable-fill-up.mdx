This counterintuitive phenomena is what population experts usually refer to as the demographic momentum, a term used to describe the delayed stopping of population increase. The fill-up effect is almost identical to the demographic momentum, but Gapminder has simplified the process by only comparing the size of cohorts.

Future changes in population can be attributed to three factors: fertility, mortality, and momentum. To find out how a population will change, demographers make up a set of variations. By keeping fertility at replacement-level or letting mortality be constant, they can analyze the effects of different fertility and mortality scenarios. In that way, demographers can compare the outcome with their main scenario, and then attribute the difference to the factor they kept constant.

If you find it hard to understand the fill-up in the text and graphs in this book, we find it easier to explain with animations or with our own hands---see[ www.gapm.io/vidfu](http://www.gapm.io/vidfu).
