      Hans was showing child survival rates on his bubble charts back then. We
      later decided to show life expectancy so that people wouldn't think we

      Next to Cuba, the new data puts Costa Rica and Panama on the same income,
      but with higher life expectancy. That wasn't the case when Hans was
      showing the graph in Cuba. The Cuban experience is described at greater
      length in Hans's memoirs; see Rosling[8].
