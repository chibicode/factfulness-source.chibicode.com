The percentages we quote take the death tolls on Level 4 for the past ten years divided by the number of all deaths on Level 4 over that period, and are based on the following data sources: [EM-DAT](http://www.emdat.be/) for natural disasters, IATA for plane crashes, [IHME[10](http://ihmeuw.org/49pc)] for murders, [UCDP[1]](http://gapm.io/xgalvac17) for wars, and [GTD](http://www.gapm.io/xgtdb17) for terrorism. A more relevant risk calculation should not just divide by the number of all deaths, but rather should take into account exposure to the situations in which these kinds of deaths can occur.
