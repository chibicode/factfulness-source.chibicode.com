      Paleodemography is an academic research field that attempts to reconstruct
      the mortality, fertility and age compositions of prehistoric populations
      based on skeletal samples from archeological sites. Experts in
      paleodemography generally expect that at least 30% of all deaths happened
      before adulthood in all archeological populations. Lewis (2006) has a list
      of sites with many recorded non-adult skeletons, and argues that
      "large numbers of non-adult remains have been recovered from cemetery
      sites, and continue to be housed in museums and universities ready for
      study." (from

      , p. 20) In general however, experts are surprised at not finding as many
      infants as they could expect, not anything near 30%. The percentage of
      infants varies enormously between sites, and occasionally, among hundreds
      of adults in certain sites, not a single child skeletal is found. Some
      studies have tried to find out why infants are underrepresented in
      archeological findings. In a study from Manifold (2014), researchers
      examined 790 child and adolescent skeletons to assess if local soil
      properties could make them more easily decomposed.
