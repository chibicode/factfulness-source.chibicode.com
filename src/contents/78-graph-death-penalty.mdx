The reason to abolish death penalty is not only the terrible risk of wrongful execution. Death penalty breaches two essential human rights: the right to life and the right to live free from torture. Both rights are protected under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, and should be respected by all 193 members states. Amnesty International keeps track of countries that have abolished the death penalty after 1990; see [www.gapm.io/xamndp17](http://www.gapm.io/xamndp17). To qualify as a country, it requires that the use of death penalty is prohibited as punishment for all crimes. Abolishment prior to 1990 in this trend comes from Wikipedia[2], see [www.gapm.io/xwiki2](http://www.gapm.io/xwiki2), and The Better Angels of Our Nature, Pinker (2011).
