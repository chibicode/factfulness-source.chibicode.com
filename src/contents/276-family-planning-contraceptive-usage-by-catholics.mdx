The data on contraceptive use in Catholic-majority countries---60 percent---come from the ARDA, using data from their [National Religion Dataset](http://www.thearda.com/Archive/Files/Codebooks/WRPNATL_CB.asp), aggregate weighted by total population. The global rates for the rest of the world come from [UN-Pop[9]](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/family-planning/cp_model.shtml), "Model-based estimates and projections: Countries."
