      This trend is based on
      <a href="http://www.gapm.io/xuisoutsf">UNESCO[3]</a>, and shows the number
      of girls of official primary school age who are enrolled in primary or
      secondary school, expressed as a percentage of the population of official
      primary school age girls. The age interval for primary education varies
      between countries, but it is often between 6 to 11 years of age. Girls of
      primary school age who are still in pre-primary education are excluded and
      considered out of school. <a href="http://www.gapm.io/xoos">UNESCO[4]</a>
      expresses the numbers in &quot;out-of-school&quot; children. We have
      inverted the numbers to show children not out-of-school: the in-school
      rate. See also the note to Fact question 1: Girls in school.
