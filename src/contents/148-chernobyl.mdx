The discussion of health investigations after Chernobyl is based on [WHO[5]](http://gapm.io/xwhoc30). In 2016, the World Health Organization published "1986-2016: Chernobyl at 30 -- an update" and they report that they couldn't confirm any large increase in cancers, like thyroid cancer, that many had expected in the population in general. Instead, they conclude: "The psycho-social impact of disasters and emergencies has been well documented. It has been reported to be the Chernobyl accident main public health impact that affected the largest number of people. A similar effect is now reported in the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, " reporting that "anxiety levels that were twice as high than non-exposed population, and were more likely to report multiple unexplained physical symptoms and subjective poor health."
