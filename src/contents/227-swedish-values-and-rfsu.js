    The earliest condoms found are from Egypt 13000 years BC. In the nineteenth
    century they became better and less expensive thanks to new rubber
    technology. Condoms were allowed in Sweden, but could only be sold by
    medical staff and up to 1939 it was prison sentence if anyone tried to
    educate about them, as it was considered demoralizing and &quot;could harm
    the family and societies and stimulate prostitution&quot;. The radical
    journalist Elise Ottesen--Jensen changed all that by educating women and
    distributing pesars. She mobilized brave women and men and brave union
    leaders to finally create the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education:
    RFSU. It wasn't until the 1970s when the laws changed.
