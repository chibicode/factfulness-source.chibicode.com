    The Internet Movie Database (<H.A href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMBd</H.A>)
    is maintained by film enthusiasts across the world, and has a nearly
    complete coverage of all feature films, making 3.5 million movies searchable
    and filterable by year. Many early cinematic recordings were done in the
