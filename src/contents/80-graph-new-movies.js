    The Internet Movie Database (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/">IMBd</a>) is
    maintained by film enthusiasts across the world, and has a nearly complete
    coverage of all feature films, making 3.5 million movies searchable and
    filterable by year. Many early cinematic recordings were done in the last
    years of the 19th century, but they dare often experimental and short we
    don't consider them feature films. We have chosen 1906 as the year of the
    first feature, referring to &quot;The Story of the Kelly Gang&quot;, a 70
    minute long narrative film; see
