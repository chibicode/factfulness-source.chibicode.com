Correct answer is C. A majority of the world population, 85.3 percent, had some access to the electricity grid in their countries, according to GTF. We rounded this down to 80 percent to avoid overstating progress. The term "access" is defined differently in all their underlying sources. In some extreme cases, households may experience an average of 60 power outages per week and still be listed as "having access to electricity." The question, accordingly, talks about "some" access. For the measures of access to electricity. GTF is a collaboration between the World Bank and the International Energy Agency; see [www.gapm.io/xgtf](http://www.gapm.io/xgtf).
