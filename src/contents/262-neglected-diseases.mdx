The World Health Organization has [a list of neglected tropical diseases](http://gapm.io/xnegtrop) (WHO[15]) that primarily affect people living on income Level 1 and markedly neglected in research and development (R&D). The illnesses on this list are not profitable to the pharmaceutical industry---only until recently, Ebola was on this list. See also [this article by Von Philipsborn (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306754/) in Glob Health Action that evaluate poverty in relation to neglect in R&D.
