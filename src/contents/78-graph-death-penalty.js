    wrongful execution. Death penalty breaches two essential human rights: the

    Amnesty International keeps track of countries that have abolished the death

    <H.A href="http://www.gapm.io/xamndp17">www.gapm.io/xamndp17</H.A>. To
    qualify as a country, it requires that the use of death penalty is
    prohibited as punishment for all crimes. Abolishment prior to 1990 in this
    trend comes from Wikipedia[2], see
    <H.A href="http://www.gapm.io/xwiki2">www.gapm.io/xwiki2</H.A>, and The
    Better Angels of Our Nature, amberer (2011).
