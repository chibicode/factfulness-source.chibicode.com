    The individual and national gains of making birth control easily available
    is described in &quot;Children of the Pill: The Effect of Subsidizing Oral
    Contraceptives on Children's Health and Wellbeing&quot; (2012). The study,
    conducted by Andreas Madestam and Emilia Simeonova, looks at the long-term
    effects of Sweden's subsidized birth-control policy in several
    municipalities between 1989 and 1998. Madestam and Simeonova report that
    women who decided to have children and were eligible for the subsidy
    achieved better health, economy and education for the next generation than
    women who decided to have children but were not eligible for improved access
    to birth-control.
