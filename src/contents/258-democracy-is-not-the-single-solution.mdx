Paul Collier's books are just as disturbing as they are fact-based. See his Wars, Guns and Votes: Democracy in Dangerous Places (2011) for more on how democracy can destabilize countries rather than make them safer. Unfortunately, this seems to hold true for countries on Level 1, where democracy is promoted by the international community, but leads to destabilization rather than safety. The promotion of so-called "democracy" is well-intended. But in practice, it often involves no more than an "election", and the winner is usually the strongest man with control of the weapons in the violent fight preceding the election. Reality is definitely not as simple as that, but we're describing the disturbing tendency. And to those who lose their loved ones, suffer starvation, violence, miss school, and remain stuck in poverty during endless civil conflicts, it is difficult to convince them about the benefits of democracy, if that's what triggered the conflict.

Collier quotes a threshold of $2700 in GDP per capita per year: over this threshold, democracy lead to more stability, but below it, war was a more likely outcome. That threshold is exactly where the line goes between Level 1 and 2 in Gapminder's income levels. More disturbing problems with democracy is discussed in a great book by Fareed Zakarias, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad. In it, Zakarias talks about legislation that has become a question for the angry crowds, who wants tougher punishment for criminals without considering the predicted costs. Read it! We must remind ourselves, in line with the wise words of Winston Churchill, that democracy, despite all its problems, in the long run, still is the least bad system we know. See [www.gapminder.org/topics/government/democracy](https://www.gapminder.org/topics/government/democracy).
