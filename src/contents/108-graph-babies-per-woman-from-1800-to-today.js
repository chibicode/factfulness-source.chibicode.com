      We use the term &quot;babies per woman&quot; for the statistical indicator
      &quot;total fertility rate&quot; (TFR). Fertility rates decline during
      times of hardship. The dips and humps before 1965 shown on the graph were
      caused by the Second World War and famines. Fertility climbs to rates
      higher than usual when the crisis is over. Globally, the average fertility
      rate was at 5.05 children in 1950, according to UN-Pop[3]. As of 2017, the
      estimated fertility rate was 2.48 children, according to UN-Pop.
      Replacement rate with the current mortality worldwide is 2.3.

      The long trend displayed on the graph shows Mattias Lindgren's work that
      compiled multiple historical sources for the years before 1950. It is
      aligned with UN-Pop[3] estimates for post-1950; see
      <a href="http://gapm.io/dtfr">Gapminder[7]</a>. The dashed line after 2017
      shows the UN-Pop[1] medium fertility projection, which is expected to
      reach 1.96 in 2099.

      For more about famines before 1965, see, for example, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine">
        Great Chinese Famine
      </a>
      , &quot;the single biggest famine event in history in terms of absolute
      numbers of death&quot; on Wikipedia. The most accurate number is probably
      estimated at 40 million people who died during the Chinese famine; see
      <a href="http://www.necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm#Mao">necrometrics</a> for a
      documentation of sources. The age structure of the Chinese population
      still bear marks of
