Correct answer is A. "Climate experts" refers to the 274 authors of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), published in 2014 by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; see IPCC[1]. Here is what they predict about the changes in the climate system, as summarized in IPCC[2]:

Surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century under all assessed emission scenarios. It is very likely that heat waves will occur more often and last longer, and that extreme precipitation events will become more intense and frequent in many regions. The ocean will continue to warm and acidify, and global mean sea level to rise.
