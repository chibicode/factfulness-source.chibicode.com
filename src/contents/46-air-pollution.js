      UNICEF writes that pneumonia remains the leading infectious cause of death
      among children under-5 years, and primarily for children under age 2.
      Pneumonia killed 2,500 children per day in 2015, mainly in extreme
      poverty. In countries like Tanzania, where half of the population live in
      extreme poverty, roughly 95 percent of household energy come from burning
      fuel, according to

      In extreme poverty, almost every home uses coal and biomass (wood, animal
      dung and crop waste) for cooking and heating. Over 4 million people die
      every year from household air pollution and over 50 percent of deaths from
      pneumonia among children under age 5 are caused by the smoke particles in
      the household; see WHO at
