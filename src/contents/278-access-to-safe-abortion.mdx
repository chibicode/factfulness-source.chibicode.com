The UNFPA[2] report about Access to Safe Abortion present these findings:

"Whether legally restricted or not, abortions continue to occur with abortion rates being higher where it is restricted than where it is permitted on request or under broad grounds (....) Where abortion is legally highly restricted, the incidence of unsafe abortion and related mortality is high. Legal restrictions also result in major inequity in access to safe providers, as women in urban areas and those who can afford to pay can access physicians or travel abroad to procure abortion."

The WHO guidelines on [Access to Safe Abortion](http://www.gapm.io/xabor) say: "Restriction in access to safe abortion services results in both unsafe abortions and unwanted births. Almost all deaths and morbidity from unsafe abortion occur in countries where abortion is severely restricted in law and/or in practice." See WHO[2] and UNFPA[2].
