    Gordon Gribble (2013) tracks the origin of chemophobia back to the
    publication of Silent Spring (1962) by Rachel Carson, and chemical accidents
    in the decades that followed. He argues that the exaggerated and irrational

    antibiotics and dioxins, but rather on pathogens, bacteria and fungi, which
    cause millions of cases of food-borne infections that result in
    hospitalization or death each year.&quot; SeeÂ
