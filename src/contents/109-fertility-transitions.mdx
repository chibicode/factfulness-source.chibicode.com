The change from large to small families in a society is called fertility transitions, and refers to long-term decline of fertility in a population. One of the most experienced demographers at UN Population Division explained it to Hans Rosling like this:

"Fertility runs the show. It's reduced fertility rate that will slow down population growth and reduced child mortality rate is one of those factors, because when 1 in 5 children is dying, a country has a very fast population growth, but mortality is still too high to allow for a strong demand for family planning. Reduced child mortality in isolation does not automatically reduce fertility, it is more of a prerequisite for lowered fertility; basic education, a move out of extreme poverty, changing values towards rights for women and access to contraceptives are the other important determinants. In fact, these major aspects of modernization must all come together for each of them to happen."

The contributing factors to lowered fertility in a population has a technical term: fertility determinants. And as the UN expert pointed out, decreasing rates in child mortality is only one of those. The full complexity is analyzed by Karen Oppenheim Mason, who in her interdisciplinary article "Explaining Fertility Transitions" reviews the main theories of fertility to assess why they present conflicting views of what makes fertility drop in a population. Oppenheim Mason argues that it is due to the following wrong assumptions:

1.  Assuming that fertility transitions have the same cause
2.  Ignoring mortality decline as a precondition for fertility decline
3.  Assuming that societies had a so-called "natural fertility" before the fertility transition
4.  Using decadal time scales to compare cause and effect

Listed first, the major problem of fertility theories is to think that all fertility transitions share one and the same cause---when in reality, a combination of conditions motivates people to prevent most births. To understand fertility decline, a number of causes must be considered. According to Oppenheim Mason, the main determinants make up:

-   Mortality decline;
-   Change of perception;
-   Access to modern contraceptives and safe abortion;
-   Costs of having many children outweighs benefits of many children.

While the above determinants are necessary to make fertility rates drop, they are not sufficient on their own, Oppenheim Mason says. And as Oppenheim Mason importantly points out, the idea of a "natural fertility" rules out the fact that many societies do have family planning strategies even though they have large families and high fertility. Changing fertility means changes in family norms, gender roles, sexual behaviour, as well as in education and economy. But the strength of cultural differences is easily overstated, and gender roles change quite fast across all cultures as people get richer, and their way of living is modernized. In cultures with extended families, including three generations, norms may survive a bit longer and the outdated expectations on women may take longer to transform. Multiple factors behind falling fertility rates are also taken into account by John Bryant, who argues that transition happens as:

-   Socio-economic circumstances change the motivation to have children;
-   Women gain access to contraceptives; and
-   New ideas spread through society.

Bryant notes that countries slow in initiating fertility drop still manage to catch up fast, and the societal improvements needed for transition become less over time. But there are two caveats of examples that break the pattern of the fertility slide. The first is pointed out by Caldwell (2008) in "Three fertility Compromises and Two transitions" (pp. 427-446), who writes that a few countries dropped their fertility rates long before mortality. Hans Rosling wrote that "Caldwell review how low fertility in historical Europe was achieved reduced access to sex by late or no marriage and strong repression on sex outside marriage." The last caveat is that on the higher incomes on Level 4, fertility begins to increase again. See, for example, this study in Nature, "Advances in development reverse fertility declines," from Myrskylä M, et al. (2008).
