      The change from large to small families in a society is called fertility
      transitions, and refers to long-term decline of fertility in a population.
      One of the most experienced demographers at UN Population Division
      explained it to Hans Rosling like this:
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Fertility runs the show. It's reduced fertility rate that will slow
      down population growth and reduced child mortality rate is one of those
      factors, because when 1 in 5 children is dying, a country has a very fast
      population growth, but mortality is still too high to allow for a strong
      demand for family planning. Reduced child mortality in isolation does not
      automatically reduce fertility, it is more of a prerequisite for lowered
      fertility; basic education, a move out of extreme poverty, changing values
      towards rights for women and access to contraceptives are the other
      important determinants. In fact, these major aspects of modernization must
      all come together for each of them to happen.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The contributing factors to lowered fertility in a population has a
      technical term: fertility determinants. And as the UN expert pointed out,
      decreasing rates in child mortality is only one of those. The full
      complexity is analyzed by Karen Oppenheim Mason, who in her
      interdisciplinary article &quot;Explaining Fertility Transitions&quot;
      reviews the main theories of fertility to assess why they present
      conflicting views of what makes fertility drop in a population. Oppenheim
      Mason argues that it is due to the following wrong assumptions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Assuming that fertility transitions have the same cause</li>
      <li>
        Ignoring mortality decline as a precondition for fertility decline
      </li>
      <li>
        Assuming that societies had a so-called &quot;natural fertility&quot;
        before the fertility transition
      </li>
      <li>Using decadal time scales to compare cause and effect</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Listed first, the major problem of fertility theories is to think that all
      fertility transitions share one and the same cause---when in reality, a
      combination of conditions motivates people to prevent most births. To
      understand fertility decline, a number of causes must be considered.
      According to Oppenheim Mason, the main determinants make up:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mortality decline;</li>
      <li>Change of perception;</li>
      <li>Access to modern contraceptives and safe abortion;</li>
      <li>
        Costs of having many children outweighs benefits of many children.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While the above determinants are necessary to make fertility rates drop,
      they are not sufficient on their own, Oppenheim Mason says. And as
      Oppenheim Mason importantly points out, the idea of a &quot;natural
      fertility&quot; rules out the fact that many societies do have family
      planning strategies even though they have large families and high
      fertility. Changing fertility means changes in family norms, gender roles,
      sexual behaviour, as well as in education and economy. But the strength of
      cultural differences is easily overstated, and gender roles change quite
      fast across all cultures as people get richer, and their way of living is
      modernized. In cultures with extended families, including three
      generations, norms may survive a bit longer and the outdated expectations
      on women may take longer to transform. Multiple factors behind falling
      fertility rates are also taken into account by John Bryant, who argues
      that transition happens as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Socio-economic circumstances change the motivation to have children;
      </li>
      <li>Women gain access to contraceptives; and</li>
      <li>New ideas spread through society.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Bryant notes that countries slow in initiating fertility drop still manage
      to catch up fast, and the societal improvements needed for transition
      become less over time. But there are two caveats of examples that break
      the pattern of the fertility slide. The first is pointed out by Caldwell
      (2008) in &quot;Three fertility Compromises and Two transitions&quot; (pp.
      427-446), who writes that a few countries dropped their fertility rates
      long before mortality. Hans Rosling wrote that &quot;Caldwell review how
      low fertility in historical Europe was achieved reduced access to sex by
      late or no marriage and strong repression on sex outside marriage.&quot;
      The last caveat is that on the higher incomes on Level 4, fertility begins
      to increase again. See, for example, this study in Nature, &quot;Advances
      in development reverse fertility declines,&quot; from Myrskyl√§ M, et al.
      (2008).
