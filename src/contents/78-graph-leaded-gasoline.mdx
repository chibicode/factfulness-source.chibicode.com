Tetraethyl lead began to be added in gasoline for increased vehicle performance and fuel economy in the 1920s, see [www.gapm.io/xwiki11](http://www.gapm.io/xwiki11). That was a stupid idea, since lead is a toxicant that affects multiple body systems and is particularly harmful to young children: See WHO's Fact sheet, Updated August 2017, called "[Lead poisoning and health](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs379/en/)".

The first country to ban lead in gasoline was Japan in 1986. Since then 192 countries have followed. The only three countries where leaded gasoline is still not completely phased out are Iraq, Yemen and Algeria, according to [UNEP[3]](http://gapm.io/xunepppo).
