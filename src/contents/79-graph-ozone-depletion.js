    The data show the impressive decline in the use of gases that are causing a
    hole in the ozone layer of the Earth's atmosphere. The ozone layer prevents
    harmful UVB wavelengths of ultraviolet light from reaching the Earth's
    surface, where it causes skin cancer, sunburn, and cataracts, all of which
    were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone. The
    UVB light is also harmful to plants and animals. When scientists presented
    evidence of the gases causing the ozone hole, the world reacted fast. All
    countries agreed to stop using these gases, and ratified the Montreal
    Protocol in 1987. Since then, humanity has almost completely stopped
    consuming Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). In 2017 the hole finally showed
    signs of shrinking as reported by

     which may be caused by warmer temperature according to

    . The trend line shows ODS Consumption in ODP Tonnes. The unit ODP tonnes is
    not an actual weight measurement, but represent the destructive effects of a
    substance compared to a reference substance. Data is compiled and available
    form <a href="http://gapm.io/xods17">UNEP[4]</a>, and the substances
    included are Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Halons, Other Fully Halogenated
    CFCs, Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform, Hydrochlorofluorocarbons
    (HCFCs), Hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), Bromochloromethane and Methyl
    Bromide.
