    These 14 graphs of differently shaped lines are all derived from plotting
    two indicators against each other and then drawing a line in the
    middle---just like the World Health Chart you see in the beginning of the
    book. We removed the background bubbles in the small images, because it got
    too cluttered. Most of these charts use national averages, aggregated by the
    national income level; see <a href="http://gapm.io/elev">Gapminder[3]</a>. A
    few (the straight line on recreational spending, the S-bend on vaccinations
    and fridges, and the slide on fertility) use household data. Our estimates
    of typical families on different income levels are not based on country
    averages, because that would severely underestimate the number of the
    poorest and mask the wide range of differences for countries on levels 1--3.
    Very few countries follow these lines exactly, but the lines show the
    general pattern of all countries over several decades. In each example,
    there are huge differences between countries on every level.
