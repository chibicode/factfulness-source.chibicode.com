The instinct to think---and act---in oppositional pairs are deeply rooted in our evolutionary survival. For the gazelle, watching out for a possible predator, the difference between "yes" and "no" could be a matter of life and death. Humans, as well, are notoriously bad at keeping a reasonable range of options at hand. Like the gazelle, we tend to instinctively pick between opposites and choose the one that would best benefit our survival. A evolutionary remnant that once saved our lives, black-and-white-thinking nowadays blocks us from weighting the good and bad, yes and no, and select something more useful, such as a "maybe". See Superforecasting by Tetlock and Gardner (2015) for more about our tendency toward urgent decision-making.
