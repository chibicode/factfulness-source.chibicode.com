    People with extraordinary expertise in one field score just as badly on our
    fact questions as everyone else. This wouldn't surprise Philip E. Tetlock
    and Dan Gardner, the authors of Superforecasting (2015). In this book they
    describe a systematic way to test people's ability to predict the future,
    and they find that one thing that can really impair good judgment is narrow
    expertise. Even forecasts by so-called experts in the media are often overly
    dramatic. When checking against actual outcomes, Tetlock and Gardner show
    that the experts not only score worse than the public but also worse than
    random. The personality traits that often come with good judgment are
    humility, curiosity, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. The Good
    Judgement Project, a forecasting services firm co-created by Tetlock, runs a
    public tournament called Good Judgement Open. You can practice your
