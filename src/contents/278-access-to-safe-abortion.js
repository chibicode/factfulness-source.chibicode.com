    <p>
      The UNFPA[2] report about Access to Safe Abortion present these findings:
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Whether legally restricted or not, abortions continue to occur with
      abortion rates being higher where it is restricted than where it is
      permitted on request or under broad grounds (....) Where abortion is
      legally highly restricted, the incidence of unsafe abortion and related
      mortality is high. Legal restrictions also result in major inequity in
      access to safe providers, as women in urban areas and those who can afford
      to pay can access physicians or travel abroad to procure abortion.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      The WHO guidelines on
      <a href="http://www.gapm.io/xabor">Access to Safe Abortion</a> say:
      &quot;Restriction in access to safe abortion services results in both
      unsafe abortions and unwanted births. Almost all deaths and morbidity from
      unsafe abortion occur in countries where abortion is severely restricted
      in law and/or in practice.&quot; See WHO[2] and UNFPA[2].
