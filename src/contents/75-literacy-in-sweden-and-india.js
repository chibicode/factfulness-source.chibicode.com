      In Sweden 100 years ago and India today, &quot;literacy&quot; may only
      mean basic recognition of letters and the ability to parse text slowly.
      The figures do not imply an ability to understand advanced written
      messages. The literacy rate for India is from India Census 2011. Historic
      literacy numbers for Sweden are from
      <a href="http://gapm.io/xriwe">van Zanden[2]</a> and
      <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/literacy">OurWorldInData[2]</a>,
      visually interpolated by Gapminder.

      The most recent census data on literacy in India puts the overall literacy
      rate at 74 percent of the population aged 7 and above. While literacy
      differed between states---for example, 64 percent in Bihar and 94 percent
      in Kerala---the numbers show a 10 percent increase since the last census
      that was published 10 years earlier. Assuming that the literacy rate
      continues to increase, it is probable that the majority of India has a
      literacy rate of at least 80 percent in 2017.

      Literacy in Sweden began to slowly increase in 1765, as the church decided
      to penalize those who didn't participate in the catechetical exams,
      conducted in households to measure people's ability to read and write (

       depict the so called &quot;house interrogations&quot; or
      &quot;husförhör&quot; in Swedish). Despite increasing rates of literacy,
      many Swedes still couldn't read and write a century later. Not until 1842,
      with the Swedish school reform making it obligatory for children to attend
      school, literacy numbers climbed further. By 1900, the literacy rate was
      at about 87 percent.
