      Hans presents this in Factpod #16, &quot;Why Boat Refugees Don't
      Fly!&quot;. see Gapminder[42]. While in the Geneva Convention says:
      &quot;&quot; , which in practice doesn't happen in EU, as this EU(2001)
      COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2001/51/EC commands: &quot;Member States shall take the
      necessary measures to oblige carriers which are unable to effect the
      return of a third-country national whose entry is refused to find means of
      onward transportation immediately and to bear the cost thereof &quot;which
      recognizes the right of persons to seek asylum from persecution in other
      countries&quot;. See

      Sweden didn't confiscate the boats belonging to those who smuggled
      refugees from Denmark during the Second World War---see the BBC
      documentary &quot;How the Danish Jews Escaped the Holocaust&quot; at 
      <a href="http://www.gapm.io/xbbcesc17">www.gapm.io/xbbcesc17</a>.
      According to Goldberger (1987) 7,220 Danish Jews were saved by these
      boats. Today, the EU Council[1] Directive 2002/90/EC defines
      &quot;smuggler&quot; as anyone facilitating illegal immigration, and the
      EU Council[2] framework decision allows &quot;confiscation of the means of
      transport used to commit the offence.&quot; The Geneva Conventions,
      however, state that many of these refugees have the right to asylum; see
      UNHCR. See <a href="http://www.gapm.io/p16">www.gapm.io/p16</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.gapm.io/tpref">www.gapm.io/tpref</a>.
