In the book we say that life expectancy in Africa today is 65 years. Estimates from UN says the number for Africa is 66 years. IHME don't present an aggregate for Africa, so Gapminder estimated the average lifespan to be 65.5 for 2017, weighted by population, using select GBD tables published in [Lancet article 2017](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31833-0/fulltext), available to download via [IHME](http://www.gapm.io/xihlex). Since population weight seems to slightly increase life expectancy, Gapminder rounded it downwards, to 65 years. Total Europe (as used in the rest of the book) has 78 years life expectancy, while Western Europe (or EU) has 82. So this comparison is assuming we use EU or Western Europe.

In 1970, the average lifespan in Sweden was 74.5 years. In their estimates for 2016, IHME combines North Africa with the Middle East, including Afghanistan, and puts life expectancy to 73.16 years, while [UN-Pop[1]](http://www.esa.un.org/unpd/wpp) estimates 71.8 years. To compare historical rates in Sweden with North Africa today, we used data from IHME, GBD (2016). Sweden in 1967 and 1970 had 74.5 years and 75.9 years in 1980, with the weighted average of 74.2 years. The five countries in North Africa with life expectancies above the world average of 72 years are as follow:

-   Algeria, 77.4 years
-   Egypt, 72.1 years
-   Libya, 75.05 years
-   Morocco, 75 years
-   Tunisia, 77.46 years

The five countries have lower Income than Sweden used to have, as you can see in the interactive graph: [http://bit.ly/2IxvIAI](https://bit.ly/2IxvIAI)

To estimate the average lifespan for the countries and regions mentioned above, we looked at GBD, the table showing life expectancy every five years from 1970 to 2016. For sub-Saharan Africa, life expectancy is 62.87 according to IHME, while UN estimates 59.7. IHME numbers are generally higher. The reasons why are [explained by Lancet](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)31833-0/fulltext). See [Gapminder[4]](http://gapm.io/ilex) for detailed documentation on life expectancy for countries and regions.
