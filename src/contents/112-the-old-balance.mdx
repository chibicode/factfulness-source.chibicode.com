Gapminder presents the old balance as a family with 6 children, out of which 4 die. This iconic family represents a theoretical average, measured over the millennia with wide ranges in mortality and fertility. In the long time-frame, however, the average family probably had no more than two surviving children, since population growth on average stayed stable until 1800.

Nobody knows the average fertility rate before 1800. In theory, the maximum number of children per woman would be between 10 and 15 children if all fertile women in a healthy population had sex often and continuously with no attempts to limit fertility. In reality, it is almost always lower than that, and six children per woman is a likely average. But fertility varies between groups and individual women and, as Gurven and Kaplan writes, it "ranges widely from below 4 to as high as 8 children per woman." (2007, p. 347)

Age specific mortality ratesÂ of the first millennials of human history are equally uncertain, but we can assume that over these huge time-horizons, mortality rate was high enough to keep population sizes down; see Livi-Bacci (1989). Mortality was unpredictable. Sudden catastrophes, caused by famines, wars or pandemics, killed many and became much more common with agriculture and crowded settlements, or through contact with other populations that brought germs with them. For regular years, between these bad periods, estimates vary from 32% to 45% of deaths in children under-5 years, which is a similar rate to that of the hunter-gatherer societies studied in modern times. Gurven and Kaplan (2007) writes that:

"The regular mortality rates differ among populations and among periods, especially in risks of violent death. However, those differences are small in a comparative cross-species perspective, and the similarity in mortality profiles of traditional peoples living in varying environments is impressive."

Before 1800, when agriculture made people crowd in settlements and diseases from domesticated animals killed many, child mortality in regular years was probably above 35%. The main sources behind our assumptions about fertility and mortality in pre-1800 families are Livi-Bacci (1989), Paine and Boldsen (2002), and Gurven and Kaplan (2007).
