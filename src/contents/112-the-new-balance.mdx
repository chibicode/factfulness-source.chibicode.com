The population curve is flat when the fill-up is completed and childbearing is on the level of replacement. The technical term called replacement-level fertility is a measure of children per woman (total fertility rate) that is needed for the next generation of a population to replace itself. About 2.1 children per woman is often assumed to be the global level of replacement, but this is only the case in periods of good health and well-being in a population. For a country to achieve fertility at replacement-level, it requires that no more than 5% of children die. If four out of six people die before reaching childbearing age, replacement fertility would be 6 children per woman. SeeÂ [www.gapm.io/eonb](http://www.gapm.io/eonb).
