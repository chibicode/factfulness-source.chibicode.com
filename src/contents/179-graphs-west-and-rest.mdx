On these graphs, where the world population is divided into west and rest, we refer to what we think the student in the European classroom had in mind --- the west consisting predominantly of Western Europe, United States, Canada, and Australia. Gapminder's rough estimates of the number of people on different incomes for 2017 are based on [World Bank official data from PovCalNet](http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet), and extended into the future with IMF forecasts. To see how the majority of people are catching up with the west, see the color-chart at the end of the book, showing the number of people on each income level separated by the four regions, or use this interactive version to animate the income mountains: [www.gapm.io/incm](http://www.gapm.io/incm).
