Correct answer is C. 60 percent of the girls in low-income countries finish primary school. According to [World Bank[3]](http://www.gapm.io/xwb173), the number was 63.2 percent in 2015, but we rounded it to 60 percent to avoid overstating progress. The definition of "low-income countries" is intentionally left out of the question, since we also aim to investigate how people interpret the term, as described in Chapter One. Primary completion rate, or gross intake ratio to the last grade of primary education, is the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the last grade of primary education, regardless of age and divided by the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary education, which is roughly at age 11.

[World Bank[2] ](http://gapm.io/xwb172)defines 31 countries as low-income countries in 2017. The data is based on estimates from [UNESCO[3]](http://gapm.io/xuisoutsf) compiled primarily from household surveys conducted by [USAID-DHS[1]](https://dhsprogram.com/) and [UNICEF-MICS](http://mics.unicef.org/). See [gapm.io/q1](http://gapm.io/q1).
