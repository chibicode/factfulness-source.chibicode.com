Don't miss [Alan Smith's TEDx talk "Why you should love statistics"](https://www.ted.com/talks/alan_smith_why_we_re_so_bad_at_statistics) where he shows great examples of local misconceptions in the UK. Gapminder is starting to develop localized visualizations, like these about Stockholm: see [www.gapm.io/gswe1](http://www.gapm.io/gswe1). Each bubble represents a small area of the city. The differences in income are disturbingly large, but just like the global picture, the areas in Stockholm are NOT divided into two groups: poor vs. rich, as it's usually sounds like in the Swedish news. Push play and see how most of Stockholm is getting richer and more educated, despite the common feeling of decline.
