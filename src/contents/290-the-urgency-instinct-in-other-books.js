    The instinct to think---and act---in oppositional pairs are deeply rooted in
    our evolutionary survival. For the gazelle, watching out for a possible
    predator, the difference between &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; could be
    a matter of life and death. Humans, as well, are notoriously bad at keeping
    a reasonable range of options at hand. Like the gazelle, we tend to
    instinctively pick between opposites and choose the one that would best
    benefit our survival. A evolutionary remnant that once saved our lives,
    black-and-white-thinking nowadays blocks us from weighting the good and bad,
    yes and no, and select something more useful, such as a &quot;maybe&quot;.
    See Superforecasting by Tetlock and Gardner (2015) for more about our
    tendency toward urgent decision-making.
