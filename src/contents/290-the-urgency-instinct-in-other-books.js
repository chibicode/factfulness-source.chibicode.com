    our evolutionary survival. For the gazelle, watching out for a possible
    predator, the difference between "yes" and "no" could be
    a matter of life and death. Humans, as well, are notoriously bad at keeping
    a reasonable range of options at hand. Like the gazelle, we tend to
    instinctively pick between opposites and choose the one that would best

    black-and-white-thinking nowadays blocks us from weighting the good and bad,
    yes and no, and select something more useful, such as a "maybe".
