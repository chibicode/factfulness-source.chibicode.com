Correct answer is A. The world population in 2017 is 7.55 billion, according to[ UN-Pop[1]](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp). That would usually be rounded to 8 billion, but we show 7 billion because we are rounding the population region by region. The populations of the [four Gapminder regions](http://gapm.io/ireg) were estimated based on national data from UN-Pop[1]: the Americas, 1.0 billion; Europe, 0.84 billion; Africa, 1.3 billion; Asia, 4.4 billion.
