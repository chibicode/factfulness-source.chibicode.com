In 2017, Gapminder worked with Ipsos-MORI and Novus to test 12,000 people in 14 countries. Their polls were conducted with online panels weighted to be representative of the adult populations. The average number of correct answers for the 12 fact questions---i.e. excluding question 13 on climate change---was 2.2, which we rounded to 2. The results of the online polls by question and country are set out in the appendix (p. 267, Factfulness). The results are also presented here: [Gapminder Misconception Study 2017](http://gapm.io/gms17).
