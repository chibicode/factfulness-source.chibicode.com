Our thinking on the ten instincts was influenced by the work of a number of brilliant cognitive scientists. Here are some of the books that completely changed our thinking about the mind and about how we should teach facts about the world:

-   Dan Ariely
    -   Predictably Irrational (2008);
    -   The Upside of Irrationality (2010);
    -   The Honest Truth About Dishonesty (2012);
-   Steven Pinker
    -   How the Mind Works (1997);
    -   The Stuff of Thought (2007);
    -   The Blank Slate (2002);
    -   The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011);
-   Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson
    -   Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) (2007);
-   Daniel Kahneman
    -   Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011);
-   Walter Mischel
    -   The Marshmallow Test (2014);
-   Philip E. Tetlock and Dan Gardner
    -   Superforecasting (2015);
-   Jonathan Gottschall
    -   The Storytelling Animal (2012);
-   Jonathan Haidt
    -   The Happiness Hypothesis (2006);
    -   The Righteous Mind (2012);
-   Thomas Gilovich
    -   How We Know What Isn't So (1991)

Many of these authors study cognitive biases. At the moment of writing, [English Wikipedia lists 186 studied biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). Psychologists struggle to capture these quirks in the mental machine in lab experiments so that they can be replicated or falsified. That's not how we developed our list of misconceptions and instincts---they only describe our hypothesis on how the common ways of wrong thinking may work.

The instinct to generalize appear in The Stuff of Thought (2007) by Steven Pinker. In his book on language and the human mind, Pinker explains how we generalize to make sense of the world. With metaphors and other linguistic tools, we use language to best accommodate our minds, for example by grouping objects and stuff of thought into categories.
