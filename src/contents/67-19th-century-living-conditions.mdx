United Kingdom probably had among the world's longest lives in 1800, on average 36 years according to Livi-Bacci (1989), A Concise History of World Population. Swedes and almost everyone else lived to 32 years or less; see [Gapminder[4]](http://gapm.io/ilex). British children began to work at an early age, on average at 10, which varied between regions. Young children were extremely valuable in British coal mines because they were small. Until 1842, many children, some as young as five years old, died while working their 10 hour shifts as trappers.
