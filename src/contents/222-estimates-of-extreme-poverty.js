      Roughly half a billion people in Africa today live in extreme poverty, as
      cited in Factfullness, p. 171. The more precise estimate from Gapminder[9]
      is 0.41 billion people, based on PovalCal[1] and IMF[1]. Keep in mind that
      there are huge uncertainties in extreme poverty, as described in the note
      Fact Question 3: Extreme Poverty.

      Paul Collier writes in The Bottom Billion (2007) about the future
      prospects for the world's poorest people, living in conflict areas on
      meager soil. To see where these people are, the thing to measure is child
      mortality, which is the most reliable indication of extreme poverty. By
      combining these four detailed maps, we can locate the poorest on earth
      with the most unfortunate future. Our rough estimate of people in extreme
      poverty close to conflicts is based on ODI (Overseas Development
      Institute) from 2015, preliminary results by Andreas Forø Tollefsen and
      Gudrun Østby of the number of people who live close to conflict worldwide
      (743 millions in 2016); download PDF
      <a href="http://www.gapm.io/xodi">here</a>. Data on where most people live
      is from United Nations Population Division; where there are high rates of
      child mortality from <a href="http://gapm.io/xih5mr">IHME[6]</a>; where
      soils give low yield from FAO[4]; and where there are conflicts from
      UCDP[2]. As long as there's conflict, most people stuck in poverty will
      have a hard time getting out.
