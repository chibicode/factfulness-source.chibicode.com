      In Energy Transitions, Smil (2010) argues that a transition to non-fossils
      will be very hard to achieve for humans. Smil's argument is difficult to
      accept, but he makes the case that a fast transition away from carbon is
      very unlikely to happen at high speed. The actions of ecosystems are hard
      to predict, but human actions are not. If nothing terrible happens, it is
      easy to imagine how humanity continues to consume resources until it's too
      late. See

      and the thinking of economist Elinor Ostrom. In her work Governing the
      Commons (1990) Ostrom explores the way in which humans across the world
      have managed to regulate their common resources to avoid overexploitation.

      In The Plundered Planet, Collier describes all kinds of natural resources
      and how humans are continuously plundering them, usually to the point that
      the process stops further exploitation, but at that point the breeding
      ground may already have become overused.
