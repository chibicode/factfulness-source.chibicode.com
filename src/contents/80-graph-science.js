    The final data-point in this curve, 2.6 million articles, is an estimate
    from Elsevier Publishing, that published 400,000 peer reviewed articles in
    2015, with the help of 700,000 peer-reviewers from a scientific community of
    7.8 million active researchers worldwide. The first peer-reviewed scientific
    journal was Philosophical Transactions published by the Royal Society in
    London. The first issue was published in March 1665 and during its first
    year in existence 119 scientific articles were printed (only counting
    articles that are more like modern day scientific articles, excluding book
    reviews and extracts from letters). Another scientific journal, Journal des
    SÃ§avans, was established in France in the same year, but without
    peer-reviewing. See &quot;Elsevier Publishing---A Look at the Numbers, and
