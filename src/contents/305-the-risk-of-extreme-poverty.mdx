The passage draws on World Bank[26], ODI, PRIO, Paul Collier's The Bottom Billion (2007), and the BBC documentary ["Don't Panic---End Poverty"](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/dont-panic-end-poverty/) from Gapminder[11].

While extreme poverty has fallen, the number of extremely poor people living in conflict has been stable or even increased, based on preliminary data from PRIO. If current wars continue, the vast majority of extremely poor children will soon live behind military lines. This poses a cultural challenge to the international aid community. The International Dialogue on Peacebuilding and Statebuilding had its fifth global meeting in Stockholm, 2016. The meeting, following the Stockholm Declaration against war and conflict, discussed how the aid community is now [preparing for the risk of extreme poverty in conflict prone countries](https://www.pbsbdialogue.org/en). See [www.gapm.io/tepov](http://www.gapm.io/tepov).

The other risks are not ongoing. Extreme poverty is. 78% are small scale farmers in extremely poor areas. In extreme poverty, every second person is a child, see [World Bank[26]](http://econ.worldbank.org/), they are from ethnic minorities; see ODI. While the global rate of poor has fallen, the number of poor in conflict has been stable or even increased, based on preliminary data from PRIO. One can only speculate about the future, but if the current wars continue, soon a vast majority of all these children will need to be helped behind a military defend line. This poses a cultural challenge to the international aid community, as Collier describes in The Bottom Million.

-   Poverty leads to civil war, and civil war leads to poverty.
-   Conflicts in Afghanistan and central Africa mean that all other sustainability projects in those places are on hold.
-   Terrorists hide in the few remaining areas of extreme poverty.
-   When rhinos are stuck in the middle of a civil war, it's much more difficult to save them.
-   There's no innovation needed to end poverty. The quicker we act, the smaller the problem (as people in extreme poverty have large families and their numbers keep increasing. )
-   The hardest to help will be those stuck behind violent and chaotic armed gangs in weakly governed states.
-   To escape poverty, they will need a stabilizing military presence of some kind. They will need police officers with guns and government authority to defend innocent citizens against violence and to allow teachers to educate the next generation in peace.

For a longer list of major risks, see Global Catastrophes and Trends: The Next Fifty Years by Smil (2008). For those who find numbers calming, this is where you will find the big picture of the proportional risks and uncertainties of all kinds of possible fatal discontinuities.
