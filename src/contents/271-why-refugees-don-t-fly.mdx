Hans presents this in Factpod #16, "Why Boat Refugees Don't Fly!". see Gapminder[42]. While in the Geneva Convention says: "" , which in practice doesn't happen in EU, as this EU(2001) COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2001/51/EC commands: "Member States shall take the necessary measures to oblige carriers which are unable to effect the return of a third-country national whose entry is refused to find means of onward transportation immediately and to bear the cost thereof "which recognizes the right of persons to seek asylum from persecution in other countries".

Sweden didn't confiscate the boats belonging to those who smuggled refugees from Denmark during the Second World War---see the BBC documentary "How the Danish Jews Escaped the Holocaust" at [www.gapm.io/xbbcesc17](http://www.gapm.io/xbbcesc17). According to Goldberger (1987) 7,220 Danish Jews were saved by these boats. Today, the EU Council[1] Directive 2002/90/EC defines "smuggler" as anyone facilitating illegal immigration, and the EU Council[2] framework decision allows "confiscation of the means of transport used to commit the offence." The Geneva Conventions, however, state that many of these refugees have the right to asylum; see UNHCR. See [www.gapm.io/p16](http://www.gapm.io/p16) and [www.gapm.io/tpref](http://www.gapm.io/tpref).
