The data on the use of contraceptives is based on UNFPA[1] and UN-Pop[9]. UNFPA is the part of the United Nations that deals with sexual and reproductive health. The data show the unmet need for family planning and are based on estimates from the UN data set, World Contraceptive Use 2017. The data set provides estimates for all women of reproductive age, 15--49 years, who are married or in a union. See, for example, [contraceptive prevalence rate](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CONM.ZS?locations=XN-XT-XD-XM) for the select countries, along with more details. You can explore the data in [the interactive chart](https://www.unfpa.org/sexual-reproductive-health)further down the page.

While we report the percentages of women who say their needs for contraceptives are met, UN publishes the reverse numbers, as rates of unmet need for family planning. It is defined as the share of women who don't want to become pregnant, or want to postpone pregnancy, but are not using any method of contraception. The data set, World Contraceptive Use 2017, is available here: [www.gapm.io/xcontr](http://www.gapm.io/xcontr). See [www.gapm.io/twmc](http://www.gapm.io/twmc).
