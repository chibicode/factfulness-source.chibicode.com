The number of warheads peaked in the mid 1980s and has steadily decreased since. SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) estimates the total number in 2017 at 14,935---see [www.gapm.io/xsipri17](http://www.gapm.io/xsipri17). The Nuclear Notebook gives a detailed breakdown: "As of mid-2017, we estimate that there are nearly 15,000 nuclear weapons located at some 107 sites in 14 countries. Roughly, 9,400 of these weapons are in military arsenals; the remaining weapons are retired and awaiting dismantlement. Approximately 4,150 are operationally available, and some 1,800 are on high alert and ready for use on short notice. By far, the largest concentrations of nuclear weapons reside in Russia and the United States, which possess 93 percent of the total global inventory."
