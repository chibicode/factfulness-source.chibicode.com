Throughout the book, when talking about personal income levels and countries' average incomes, we use a doubling scale. This is because the impact of another dollar is completely different on different income levels. Doubling (or logarithmic) scales are also used for measuring the size of earthquakes, populations, sound levels, pH levels, and in many other situations when comparing numbers across a large range and where small differences between small numbers are as important as big differences between big numbers. It's not a mistake, it's not cheating. It's representing the world as it really is: in this case, a world where it is not size of the pay rise that matters, but the size of the pay rise in relation to what you had before. Logarithmic scales are based on the theory of diminishing marginal value, first proposed by Daniel Bernoulli in 1738, as Kahneman (2011) describes in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow (p. 274). Doubling scales are explained with more examples in Factfulness on page 98. See [www.gapm.io/esca](http://www.gapm.io/esca).
