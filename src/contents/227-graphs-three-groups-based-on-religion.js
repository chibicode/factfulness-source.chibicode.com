      In a sense, it is ridiculous to show only three kinds of religions. The
      variations of people's spiritual beliefs are probably just as many as
      there are people. If you search the internet for family trees of world
      religions you will see how they all branch from a few common beliefs,
      splitting into a myriad of different interpretations, practices and belief
      systems that keeps splitting over the decades. It is unusual that
      religious groups emerge, just like branches on a tree.

      Globally, roughly 1.1 billion people do not affiliate with any of the
      world's largest religions, such as atheists, agnostics, or those without
      any particular religion. The number of people who affiliate with the
      world's large religions represent about 2.1 billion Christians, 1.6
      billion Muslims and about 2.6 billion other large religions (1 billion
      Hindus, 0.5 billion Buddhists). The numbers come from
      <H.A href="http://gapm.io/xpewrel1">PEW[2]</H.A> and the ARDA[1], where you
      can find percentages of people following each religion.
