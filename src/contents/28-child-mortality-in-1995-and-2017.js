      Child mortality data used in the 1995 lecture came from UNICEF[1]. In this
      book we have updated the examples, using 2017 estimations from
      <a href="http://www.childmortality.org/">UN-IGME</a>---a data
      collaboration between UNICEF, WHO, UN Population Division and the World
      Bank. The numbers used in the evening lecture back in 1995 were only
      slightly different: Saudi Arabia in 1960 was 292 and in 1993, 38; Malaysia
      in 1960 was 105 and in 1993, 17; Brazil in 1960 was 181 and in 1993, 63;
      Tanzania in 1960 was 249 and in 1993, 16.

      The data from UNICEF[1] is based on The State of the World's Children
      1995, published by Oxford U P, available to download as

      . Data for 2017 is derived from &quot;Child Mortality Estimates&quot;
      from <a href="http://www.childmortality.org/">www.childmortality.org</a>.
      UN-IGME---United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality
      Estimation---is a data collaboration between UNICEF, WHO, UN Population
      Division and the World Bank.
