Correct answer is C. None of the three species are classified as more critically endangered today than they were in 1996. The data is based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species; see IUCN Red List[4] below, with tables on the numbers of threatened species between 1996 and 2017.

The tiger (Panthera tigris) was classified as Endangered (EN) in 1996, and it still is; see [IUCN Red List[1]](http://www.gapm.io/xiucnr1). According to a statement from [WWF](http://gapm.io/xwwftiger) in 2016, the number of wild tigers are increasing: "After a century of decline, tiger numbers are on the rise. At least 3,890 tigers remain in the wild, but much more work is needed to protect this species that's still vulnerable to extinction." See also Platt (2016) in Scientific American [reporting on the rising tiger numbers](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/extinction-countdown/tiger-populations-increasing/).

According to [IUCN Red List[2]](http://www.gapm.io/xiucn2), the giant panda was classified as Endangered (EN) in 1996, but in 2015, new assessments of increasing wild populations resulted in a change of classification to the less critical status of Vulnerable (VU).

The black rhino was classified as Critically Endangered (CR) and still is; see IUCN [Red List[3]](http://www.gapm.io/xiucn3). The International Rhino Foundation states that wild populations are slowly increasing, estimating the population at 5,042--5,455 in their [annual report for 2016](https://rhinos.org/newsroom/annual-report-financials/). And the slow increase remains in March 2018, according to updates from the [Rhino foundation](https://rhinos.org/state-of-the-rhino/). See [www.gapm.io/q11](http://www.gapm.io/q11).
