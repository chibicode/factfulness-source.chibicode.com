Many studies claim to show that the number of refugees will increase dramatically because of climate change. The UK Government Office for Science showed in their study [Migration and Global Environmental Change](http://www.gapm.io/xcli17) (Foresight, 2011) fundamental weaknesses in the common assumptions underlying these claims. First it found that most of the frequently quoted studies refer back to just two original sources, one estimating that climate change will create 10 million refugees and the other anticipating 150 million; see Box 1.2: "Existing estimates of 'numbers of environmental migrants' tend to be based on one or two sources." And second, it found that these original sources underestimate people living on Levels 1 and 2 and their ability to cope with change. They describe migration as their only option in the face of climate change. For a fact-based picture of global migration and the refugee situation, see [UNHCR Population Statistics](http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/overview). Important books on global migration are Alexander Betts's and Paul Collier's Refuge(2017) and Collier's Exodus (2013).
