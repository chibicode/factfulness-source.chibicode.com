In Energy Transitions, Smil (2010) argues that a transition to non-fossils will be very hard to achieve for humans. Smil's argument is difficult to accept, but he makes the case that a fast transition away from carbon is very unlikely to happen at high speed. The actions of ecosystems are hard to predict, but human actions are not. If nothing terrible happens, it is easy to imagine how humanity continues to consume resources until it's too late.

This passage also draws on The Plundered Planet by Paul Collier (2010), [OurWorldInData[7]](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-parties-env-agreements)and the thinking of economist Elinor Ostrom. In her work Governing the Commons (1990) Ostrom explores the way in which humans across the world have managed to regulate their common resources to avoid overexploitation. Read more about [Ostrom and her design principles of common pool resource administration](https://www.en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom).

In The Plundered Planet, Collier describes all kinds of natural resources and how humans are continuously plundering them, usually to the point that the process stops further exploitation, but at that point the breeding ground may already have become overused.
