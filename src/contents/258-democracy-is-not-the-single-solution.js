        ポール・コリアーの著作は事実に基づいており、同時に恐しいものでもある。レベル1の国では、民主主義によって、国は安全になるどころか不安定になることは、『民主主義がアフリカ経済を殺す─最底辺の10億人の国で起きている事実』(2010年、甘粕智子訳、日経BP社)に詳しく描かれている。

      Unfortunately, this seems to hold true for countries on Level 1, where
      democracy is promoted by the international community, but leads to
      destabilization rather than safety. The promotion of so-called
      "democracy" is well-intended. But in practice, it often involves
      no more than an "election", and the winner is usually the
      strongest man with control of the weapons in the violent fight preceding
      the election. Reality is definitely not as simple as that, but we're
      describing the disturbing tendency. And to those who lose their loved
      ones, suffer starvation, violence, miss school, and remain stuck in
      poverty during endless civil conflicts, it is difficult to convince them
      about the benefits of democracy, if that's what triggered the conflict.

      Collier quotes a threshold of $2700 in GDP per capita per year: over this
      threshold, democracy lead to more stability, but below it, war was a more
      likely outcome. That threshold is exactly where the line goes between
      Level 1 and 2 in Gapminder's income levels.

        民主主義の問題点についてはさらに、Fareed Zakaria著のThe Future of
        Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroadでも指摘している
      </H.FB>
      In it, Zakarias talks about legislation that has become a question for the
      angry crowds, who wants tougher punishment for criminals without
      considering the predicted costs. Read it!

        「民主主義がまるで完璧か、万能であるかのように偽ることはできない。実際、民主主義は最悪の政治形態だ。ただし、これまでに試されたほかの政治形態で民主主義よりましなものがなかっただけだ」。
