Paul Hermann Müller won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1948 for "his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison against several arthropods." Hungary was the first country to ban DDT, in 1968, followed by Sweden in 1969. The United States banned it three years later; see CDC[2]. At the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2004, the UN quickly helped to set up an international treaty against various pesticides, including DDT, which has entered into force in 158 countries; see [http://www.pops.int](http://www.pops.int/).

Since the 1970s, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and EPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) have issued directives on how to avoid the dangers of DDT to humans; see [Toxicological profile for DDT, DDE and DDD](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=81&tid=20) and the EPA [Pesticide information](http://gapm.io/xepa17). CDC correctly label direct DDT exposure to humans as unhealthy, but also state that the "health effects from DDT at low environmental doses are unknown." Today, the World Health Organization promotes the use of DDT to save lives in poor settings by killing malaria mosquitoes, within strict safety guidelines: ["The use of DDT in malaria vector control"](http://gapm.io/xwhoddt1) and [DDT in Indoor Residual Spraying](http://gapm.io/xwhoddt2) from WHO[6,7].

The CDC produced this 497 page document: [Toxicological profile for DDT, DDE and DDD](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=81&tid=20). We refer to the CDC as the source for the DDT report, even if it is signed by the [Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/) (ATSDR). ATSDR is a component of CDC's CIOs (Center, Institute, and Offices) and one of the CDC's independent expert groups within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; see the [CDC's organizational structure](https://www.cdc.gov/about/organization/cio.htm).
