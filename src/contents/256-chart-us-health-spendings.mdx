The United States spends much more on health care than other capitalist countries on Level 4---the European Union, Japan, and South Korea. The health spending data comes from WHO's [Global Health Expenditure Database](http://apps.who.int/nha/database), via World Bank[24]. This comparison between US spending and spending in other countries comes from OECD[1], a study named "Why Is Health Spending in the United States So High?"

Compared to other OECD countries, the US spends more on all parts of the system---hospitals, ambulatory care, pharmaceuticals, and public health and administration---which indicate that spending in the US health-care system is generally much higher across the board. The component that stands out is ambulatory care providers---that is, physicians, specialists, dentists, etc. The other most exaggerated costs are public health and administration of the US health system, which is 60 percent higher than in the rest of the OECD countries.

The study continues to ask: Is the US providing too much health care? In some common practices, the answer is clearly yes---when comparing the cost of regular health delivery in US and France, the US health costs are 50 percent higher, which is in large part due to unnecessary doctor's appointments, along with costly diagnostic equipment and over-testing. These frequent doctor consultations and elective health interventions, as we see, do not lead to healthier or longer lives on average. In fact, it is the opposite. In other countries, that same amount of time with doctors is spent on patients with worse conditions and payed through public insurance. A few sub-systems are performing well, in terms of patient content and cancer rates, as can be seen in the 32 improvements charts, where the outcomes have been marvelous for those who got treatment. But the US health system do not provide incentives for doctors to spend time with the patients most in need of care. See [www.gapm.io/theasp](http://www.gapm.io/theasp).

There are two small countries that are excluded from the comparison above. The Marshall Islands is reported to have similar health expenditure per capita as the US, but we don't mention it because of its incomparable size. Maldives is also very small, and it's under the horizontal line, and can't be seen in the chart.
