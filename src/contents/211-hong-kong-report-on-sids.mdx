The number of sudden infant deaths fell during the 1990s due to successful intervention campaigns telling mothers not to leave their babies in the prone position. But these campaigns only helped bring down the rates of sudden infant deaths to the same low levels where they used to be, before the prone position was promoted. The same pattern evolved in the US, Norway and Sweden. The conclusion that it was public health policy on the prone position that caused the increase in SIDS in Sweden is described by Gilbert et al. (2005) and Högberg and Bergström (1997), who brought this to our attention with their article "Läkarråd ökade risken för plötslig spädbarnsdöd" ["Physicians' advice increased the risk of sudden infant death syndrome"].

The report from Hong Kong is from Davies (1985). The study was the first to suggest that the practice of placing babies in prone position could be the cause of sudden infant deaths; see [Cot death in Hong Kong: a rare problem?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2866397?dopt=Abstract) and [this follow-up report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1835990/) from N.N. Lee (1989).
