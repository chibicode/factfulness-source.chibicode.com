      The number of sudden infant deaths fell during the 1990s due to successful
      intervention campaigns telling mothers not to leave their babies in the
      prone position. But these campaigns only helped bring down the rates of
      sudden infant deaths to the same low levels where they used to be, before
      the prone position was promoted. The same pattern evolved in the US,
      Norway and Sweden. The conclusion that it was public health policy on the
      prone position that caused the increase in SIDS in Sweden is described by
      Gilbert et al. (2005) and Högberg and Bergström (1997), who brought this
      to our attention with their article &quot;Läkarråd ökade risken för
      plötslig spädbarnsdöd&quot; [&quot;Physicians' advice increased the risk
      of sudden infant death syndrome&quot;].

      The report from Hong Kong is from Davies (1985). The study was the first
      to suggest that the practice of placing babies in prone position could be
      the cause of sudden infant deaths; see
