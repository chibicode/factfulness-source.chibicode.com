Correct answer is C. 88 percent of 1-year-old children in the world today are vaccinated against some disease, according to [WHO[1]](http://gapm.io/xwhoim). We rounded it down to 80 percent to avoid overstating progress. The common vaccines that reached most 1-year-olds worldwide in 2016, sorted by coverage level, are as follows:

-   BCG (Tuberculosis): 88%
-   DTP3 (Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis): 86%
-   MCV1 (Measles, 1st dose): 85%
-   Pol3 (Polio): 85%
-   HepB3 (Hepatitis B): 84%
-   PAB (Neonatal tetanus): 84%
-   Hib3 (Haemophilus influenzae type b): 70%
-   MCV2 (Measles, 2nd dose): 64%
-   PCV3 (Pneumococcal conjugate): 42%
-   RotaC (Rotavirus): 15%

The estimate for immunization coverage of the vaccine against TB is based on [Global Health Observatory data](http://www.who.int/gho/tb/en/) from WHO[10]. For vaccination data by category, see[ WHO[1]](http://www.gapm.io/xwhoim). See [www.gapm.io/q9](http://www.gapm.io/q9).
