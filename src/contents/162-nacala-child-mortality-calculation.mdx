The births and population data used for these calculations is based on the Mozambique census of 1970, the Nacala hospital's own records, and UN-IGME of 2017. The deaths in the hospital are based on Hans's own notes. The official child mortality estimate for the whole country was probably different back then. For this calculation example, we use the latest available estimate for that year from [UN-IGME](http://www.childmortality.org/) of 2017. Mozambique was the poorest country in the world in 1979, according to the World Bank's latest available estimates; see [www.gapminder.org/whc](https://www.gapminder.org/whc). According to [WHO[8]](http://gapm.io/xwhowf), the number of doctors per 100,000 people in 1980 was 2.2 in Sweden, and 0.0255 in Mozambique. After the liberation in Mozambique, extremely few doctors remained in the remote districts; see World Bank[24].
