The list of the low-cost, high-impact interventions that save the most lives comes from UNICEF[2], which also set out the essential basic health care to which all citizens should have access before public health budgets start being spent on more advanced care. The publication from UNICEF[2] is called "Narrowing the Gaps---The Power of Investing in the Poorest Children" (2017), and is available for PDF download here:Â [www.gapm.io/xunicef2](http://www.gapm.io/xunicef2).
