The bad habit of reducing all problems to one single problem---the climate---is sometimes called climate reductionism. The term sometimes refer to the monocausality explanation that "all climate change has a single cause, often CO2". To confront such simplicity is not to deny climate change. It is to have realistic expectations about how people will cope with it in relation to other challenges and problems. Climate change is among other problems, and it is there are many examples in world history of humans adapting to new circumstances.

The idea of climate change as a single scenario is refuted by Smil (2008). In his book Global Catastrophes and Trends, Smil uses global warming as a good example of a process that is too complex to happen as a single event. An assumption that is questioned by Johan Rockström and others who insist that this line of thinking may be a case of the straight line instinct. Smil argues that climate change will probably not lead to a catastrophic event destroying everything at ones, but neither will it be a slow transition that we won't notice. The future effects of climate change will have aspect of both fast and gradual transition. Fascinating examples of pivotal moments in human history, in regards to food and energy consumption, is also given by Ruth DeFries (2014). In The Big Ratchet, DeFries convincingly shows how the current human-produced system is unsustainable, with fertilizers and depletion of natural resources, without claiming that this must necessarily lead to a sudden catastrophic event.
