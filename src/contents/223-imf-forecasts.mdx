Our comments on the IMF's forecasting track record are based on the World Economic Outlook; see IMF[2]. IMF forecasts are used for speculations about future growth in the stock and finance industry, as [BBC News](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-22228223) points out. [Here](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4117923-2017-q4-stock-market-outlook-u-s-economy-reaching-peak) is one example of such speculations.

See [www.gapm.io/eecof](http://www.gapm.io/eecof). The following graphs are from IMF forecast track record, based on the World Economic Outlook from previous years IMF[2-10]:
