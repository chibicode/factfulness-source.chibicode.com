The data show the impressive decline in the use of gases that are causing a hole in the ozone layer of the Earth's atmosphere. The ozone layer prevents harmful UVB wavelengths of ultraviolet light from reaching the Earth's surface, where it causes skin cancer, sunburn, and cataracts, all of which were projected to increase dramatically as a result of thinning ozone. The UVB light is also harmful to plants and animals. When scientists presented evidence of the gases causing the ozone hole, the world reacted fast. All countries agreed to stop using these gases, and ratified the Montreal Protocol in 1987. Since then, humanity has almost completely stopped consuming Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS). In 2017 the hole finally showed signs of shrinking as reported by [MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2016/signs-healing-antarctic-ozone-layer-0630) which may be caused by warmer temperature according to [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/warm-air-helped-make-2017-ozone-hole-smallest-since-1988). The trend line shows ODS Consumption in ODP Tonnes. The unit ODP tonnes is not an actual weight measurement, but represent the destructive effects of a substance compared to a reference substance. Data is compiled and available form [UNEP[4]](http://gapm.io/xods17), and the substances included are Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Halons, Other Fully Halogenated CFCs, Carbon Tetrachloride, Methyl Chloroform, Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), Hydrobromofluorocarbons (HBFCs), Bromochloromethane and Methyl Bromide.
