The current ILO (International Labour Organization) definition of "child labor" excludes light part-time work, and includes only the so called "worst forms of child labour"; see [ILO[6]](http://gapm.io/xilo182). [Gapminder[42]](about:blank) combines data from three different ILO reports, using three age intervals; ILO[[7](http://gapm.io/xiloi),[8](http://gapm.io/xiloipe),[9](https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor)]. The actual degree of child labor is uncertain, but the trend of decline is evident in all sources measured consistently over time. Data from [ILO[8] ](http://gapm.io/xiloipe)covers the years 2000--2012. It overlaps in time with [ILO[7]](http://gapm.io/xiloi) but reports data for a wider age-interval spanning the years 5--17 years. The overlapping years in ILO[8] were used to align with ILO[7]. The ILO[9] data is from the ILO Programme on Estimates and Projections on the Elimination of Child Labour and covers the period 1950--1995. The age interval reported here is 10--14 years. For 1950, 27.6 percent is the estimate of children were involved in child labor. This is probably a low estimate, considering that a majority of children didn't go to school in the 1950s--- only one third did in China and India, according to [Barro-Lee](http://gapm.io/xbl17). We don't know if these children out of school were used for labor under bad conditions, so we decided to use this official ILO estimate, even though it reports on an older age group. While the global decline of child labor is certain, the actual levels at all times are not. Since writing this book, new numbers supporting our general estimates have been published on [OurWorldInData[3]](https://ourworldindata.org/child-labor).
