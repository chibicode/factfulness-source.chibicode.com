This trend is based on [UNESCO[3]](http://www.gapm.io/xuisoutsf), and shows the number of girls of official primary school age who are enrolled in primary or secondary school, expressed as a percentage of the population of official primary school age girls. The age interval for primary education varies between countries, but it is often between 6 to 11 years of age. Girls of primary school age who are still in pre-primary education are excluded and considered out of school. [UNESCO[4]](http://www.gapm.io/xoos)expresses the numbers in "out-of-school" children. We have inverted the numbers to show children not out-of-school: the in-school rate. See also the note to Fact question 1: Girls in school.
