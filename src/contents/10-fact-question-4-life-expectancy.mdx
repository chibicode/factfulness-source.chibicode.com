Correct answer is C. The average global life expectancy for those born in 2016 was 72.48 years, according to [IHME[1]](http://gapm.io/xihlex). The [UN-Pop[3]](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp) estimate is slightly lower, at 71.9 years. We rounded it to 70 to avoid overstating progress. The three answer alternatives were chosen by Gapminder after first having asked the question with an open answer field, letting respondents write any age they wanted. Most people wrote 50 or 60 years. See [www.gapm.io/q4](http://www.gapm.io/q4).
