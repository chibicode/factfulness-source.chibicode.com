    Large parts of the UN still use the term "developing countries", but there
    is no common definition. The UN Statistics Division (2017) uses it for
    so-called "statistical convenience", finding it convenient to classify as
    many as 144 countries as developing (including Qatar and Singapore, two of
    the healthiest and richest countries on the planet). The World Economic
    Forum re-posted the World Bank announcement of phasing out the division in
    "developed" and "developing", but continues to use the term. From only a few
    years back the term appears in several headlines on their website: "84% of
    refugees live in developing countries" (June 20, 2017), "5 ways to make
    global trade work for developing countries" (September, 2016), and "Digital
    can lift the developing world out of poverty" (July 10, 2017). This
    illustrates one aspect of the problematic definitions. In the first article,
    the number is taken from a report issued by UNHCR where "developing
    countries" refers to the outdated list of the UN Statistics Division. In the
    second and third, "developing countries" and "developing world" actually
    refer to the
    <H.A href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category.html">
      UN list of Least Developed Countries
    </H.A>
    , which is updated every third year, taking into account per capita income,
    human assets and economic vulnerability.
