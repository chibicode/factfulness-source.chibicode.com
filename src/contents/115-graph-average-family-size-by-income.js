      The graph presenting family size by income uses the most recent available
      data from World Bank[5] estimating that 10.7 percent of the population
      lived in extreme poverty in 2013.
      <a href="http://gapm.io/depov">Gapminder[9]</a> has extended the data to
      2017, using IMF's GDP per capita growth, and estimates that 0.75 billion
      people of the world population live on less than $2 a day; that is 10
      percent of 7.55 billion people in the world. UN and the World Bank has set
      the threshold of extreme poverty at $1.9. Since these numbers are very
      rough estimates, Gapminder has rounded up the threshold to $2 a day.

      Our estimates for families on difÂ­ferent income levels are based on
      household data compiled by Countdown to 2030 and GDL[1,2], combining
      hundreds of households surveys from UNICEF-MICS, USAID-DHS[1], IPUMS, and
      others. Instead of using national averages, household data allow us to
      include families on Level 1, as well as the poorest families living in
      countries on Level 2 and 3. The income levels of households in these
      datasets are estimated from their material assets, for instance by the
      number of people per sleeping room, floor-material and means of transport.
