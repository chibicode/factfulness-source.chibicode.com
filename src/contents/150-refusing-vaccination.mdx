In the US, 4 percent of parents think that vaccines are not important, according to [Gallup[3]](http://gapm.io/xgalvac17.). In 2016, Larson et al. found that, across 67 countries, an average of 13 percent of people were skeptical about vaccination in general. There were huge variations between countries: from more than 35 percent in France and Bosnia and Herzegovina to 0 percent in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh. In 1990, measles was the cause of 7 percent of all child deaths. Today, thanks to vaccination, it is only 1 percent. Deaths from measles mainly happen on Level 1 and Level 2, where children only recently started to get vaccinated; see [IHME[7]](http://gapm.io/xihels) and [WHO[1]](http://gapm.io/xwhoim).
