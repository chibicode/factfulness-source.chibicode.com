The world has emerged into a continuous in which services and industries move more freely. In The world is flat, Thomas L. Friedman (2005) describes how most of the things we take for granted about business, worklife, and the future, are no longer true. At the same time, globalization has only started, as described so well by Fareed Zakaria (2008), who calls it The Post-American World in his book with the same title. Zakaria makes these important points:

-   Outsourcing to level 2  -- same quality for less than half the price. Textiles industry Europe > Bangladesh and Cambodia > Kenya and other African countries as Bangladesh and Cambodia become wealthier and approach Level 3.
-   Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya are some of the best investment opportunities that can be found today.

These two books opened my eyes and made me brave, because I realized that others were seeing what I was seeing. Farred invited me to his studio where I showed how China will catch up also, and how large parts of rural China are lagging dangerously behind.
