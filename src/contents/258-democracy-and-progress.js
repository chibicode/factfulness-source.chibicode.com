    Democracy is not a prerequisite for social and economic progress. Mostly
    non-democracies grow fast. South Korea, for instance, moved from Level 1 to
    Level 3, all the time as a military dictatorship. This discussion is based
    on IMF[1], the 
    <a href="http://gapm.io/ximfw">World Economic Outlook 2017</a> and the 
    <a href="http://gapm.io/xecodemi">Democracy Index 2016</a> from The
    Economist[2]. This index gives countries &quot;democracy&quot; ratings on a
    scale of 1 to 10, with the lowest score of 1.8 going to North Korea and the
    highest score of 9.93 to Norway. These are the 10 countries with the fastest
    economic growth over the past five years and their democracy scores (fastest
    first): Turkmenistan, 1.83; Ethiopia, 3.6; China, 3.14; Mongolia, 6.62;
    Ireland, 9.15; Uzbekistan, 1.95; Myanmar, 4.2; Laos, 2.37; Panama, 7.13;
    Georgia, 5.93. Only one out of the ten fastest-growing economies scores well
    on democracy.
