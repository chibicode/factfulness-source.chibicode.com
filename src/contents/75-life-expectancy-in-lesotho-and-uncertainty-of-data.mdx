In 2016, only two countries had a life expectancy as low as 50 years according to [IHME[1]](http://gapm.io/xihlex)--- The Central African Republic at 50.2 years and Lesotho at 50.3 years. The uncertainties are huge for all health estimates on Level 1. According to the IHME models, the confidence interval for these numbers are ±2.5 years. That is only expressing the uncertainty within the model. When IHME change their model and improve their estimation calculations, the country estimates may change outside these uncertainty intervals. Between the previous two revisions, estimates for 24 percent of all countries changed beyond the confidence interval. In the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013, for example, Botswana's life expectancy for 2013 was estimated between 62.6 and 68.7 years. In the Global Burden of Disease 2015 revision, the lower estimate for 2013 was adjusted downwards by 5.7 years, down to 56.9. This was mainly due to an improved modelling of the HIV pandemic. This is just one example of the actual size of uncertainty of health estimates on Level 1 and 2. There are no examples of such large  adjustments for estimates when it comes to countries on Level 3 and 4, where data is more certain.
