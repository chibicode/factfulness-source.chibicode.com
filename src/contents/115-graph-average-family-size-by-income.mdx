The graph presenting family size by income uses the most recent available data from World Bank[5] estimating that 10.7 percent of the population lived in extreme poverty in 2013. [Gapminder[9]](http://gapm.io/depov) has extended the data to 2017, using IMF's GDP per capita growth, and estimates that 0.75 billion people of the world population live on less than $2 a day; that is 10 percent of 7.55 billion people in the world. UN and the World Bank has set the threshold of extreme poverty at $1.9. Since these numbers are very rough estimates, Gapminder has rounded up the threshold to $2 a day.

Our estimates for families on dif­ferent income levels are based on household data compiled by Countdown to 2030 and GDL[1,2], combining hundreds of households surveys from UNICEF-MICS, USAID-DHS[1], IPUMS, and others. Instead of using national averages, household data allow us to include families on Level 1, as well as the poorest families living in countries on Level 2 and 3. The income levels of households in these datasets are estimated from their material assets, for instance by the number of people per sleeping room, floor-material and means of transport.
