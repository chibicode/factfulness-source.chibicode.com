      When classifying countries based on religion, we no longer use the term
      'majority religion'. We only use this term when talking about the 40
      countries back in 1960 (p. 175 in Factfulness) for comparison. Estimates
      of <a href="http://gapm.io/xpewrel1">Religious Composition by Country</a>
      by Pew Research Center show percentages of those affiliated with any
      religion (or not) by country as of 2010 and in the future. In most
      countries, more than 50% of the population adhere to one of the large
      religions. However, in many countries there is no clear majority. In
      Nigeria, for example, 49 percent of the population was Christian and 48
      percent Muslim in 2010, according to our data on religion; see Pew[2,3].

      We have split 81 such countries into three separate bubbles in the
      relevant charts, using Pew[2] and USAID-DHS[2]. To estimate each religious
      group's fertility rate, and roughly estimating each religious group's per
      capita income, we have used data from GDL[1,2], OECD[3] and other sources.
