The Indian legend, depicting the effect of doubling, is called the [Legend of the Ambalappuzha Paal Payasam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambalappuzha_Sri_Krishna_Temple#Legend_of_the_Ambalappuzha_Paal_Payasam), named after the temple where it supposedly happened. In calculating the volume of rice to cover India, the total number of grains Lord Krishna is owed were divided by India's total land area. The grains' estimated weight and volume---300 grains of rice equals 6 grams (thanks, [gapm.io/xrice](http://www.gapm.io/xrice))---were converted into density per square meter, using this grain converter: [gapm.io/xcalc](http://www.gapm.io/xcalc).
