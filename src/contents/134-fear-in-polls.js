    In the passage about the most common fears, we refer to those self-reported
    among adults. The polls, conducted in the United States and the United
    Kingdom respectively, reported similar results. In the Gallup[2] survey, top
    US fears were snakes; public speaking; and heights, followed by entrapment;
    spiders and insects; needles; ice; flying; and dogs. In the poll from
    YouGov[2], the leading fears in the United Kingdom were heights; snakes; and
    public speaking; followed by spiders; entrapment; mice; needles; and
    airplanes. Read more about the fear instinct at
