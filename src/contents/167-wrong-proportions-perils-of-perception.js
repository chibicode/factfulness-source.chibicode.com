      the wealth that the top 1 percent owns, the average guess was 59 percent,
      when the correct figure is 23 percent; on immigration, they guessed that
      25 percent of the population are immigrants, when the the correct figure
      is 13 percent.

      disproportionality, asking, for example, how much the level of the Red Sea
      would rise if you added all the human blood in the world.
