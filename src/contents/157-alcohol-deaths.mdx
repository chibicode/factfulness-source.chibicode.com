Our calculations on deaths involving alcohol draw on [IHME[9]](http://ihmeuw.org/49pa), NHTSA (2017), FBI, and BJS. Data on traffic fatalities come from NHTSA (2017). In 2016, drunk drivers in the United States killed 948 pedestrians and cyclists, 1,550 passengers in the vehicles they were driving, and 1,520 in other vehicles---a total of 4,018 deaths, of which 1,233 were children. For murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, US statistics are not as transparent with information on blood-alcohol concentrations in offenders. The total number for 2016 was 17,250 homicide victims, according to FBI. To guess how many of those involved a drunk murder, we went to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, BJS[1], Alcohol and Crime: Data From 2002 to 2008, which reported a rate between 19--37 percent. We used the lower estimate of 20 percent, estimating that 3,450 homicides occured when the murderer was under the influence. One caveat here is that many of these deaths could theoretically have happened without the perpetrator being drunk. Domestic violence often involves alcohol (roughly 50 percent), but after the perpetrator (almost always the man) stops drinking, the violence may continue in half of the cases, according to Klostermann (2006).

The total estimate is that alcohol was in the drivers and murderers who killed 7,468 people in the United States 2016. Compared to a terrorism average of 155 per year (which includes 9/11). That would give us a US figure of roughly 9,000 deaths a year. That difference in risks between terrorism and alcoholism figures are is similar comparable across most European countries on Level 4, which all have quite terrible drinking habits: the risk that your loved one will be killed by a drunk person is 50 48 times higher than the risk they will be killed by a terrorist.
