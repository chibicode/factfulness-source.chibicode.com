A small version of the Spanish flu is more likely to occur than a large one; see Smil (2008). While we should work against the obscene overuse of antibiotics in the meat industry---see WHO[14] [Antimicrobial resistance](http://gapm.io/xantimicres)---we must also be careful not to make the same mistake as we did with DDT and become overprotective. Antibiotics could save even more lives if they were less expensive. See [www.gapm.io/tgerm](http://www.gapm.io/tgerm).
