Gapminder polled the public, asking the question with an open-answer field so respondents were not limited by our three predefined alternatives. In the US, 61 percent of respondents entered a value above 50 percent, guessing that a majority of people live in low-income countries. The average guesses were 57 percent in the US and 61 percent in Sweden, see [Novus[3]](http://gapm.io/pollnov17bnovus-17b). Gapminder also asked the same question but with "low-income countries" replaced by "developing countries". The results were the same, as if the terms were synonyms.
