The Population Bomb by Paul and Anne Ehrlich (1968) contributed to a widespread idea that Asia and Africa would never be able to feed their growing populations. A total of 3.5 million people died in the so-called Bengal famine in 1942--1943: 2 million in Bangladesh and 1.5 million in India, based on the territorial boundaries today. The data on deaths from famines is from the International Disaster Database, EM-DAT.
