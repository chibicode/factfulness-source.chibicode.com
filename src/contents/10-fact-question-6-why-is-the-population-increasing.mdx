Correct answer is B. In their forecasts, the UN experts (i.e. the demographers of the UN Population Division) calculate that 1 percent of population increase will come from 0.37 billion more children (age 0 to 14), 69 percent from 2.5 billion more adults (age 15 to 74), and 30 percent from 1.1 billion more very old people (age 75 and older). The data comes from [UN-Pop[3]](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp). See [www.gapm.io/q6](http://www.gapm.io/q6).
