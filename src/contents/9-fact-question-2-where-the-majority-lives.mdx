The correct answer is B. The majority of people live in middle-income countries. The definitions of the three income groups are intentionally left out of the question, since we also aim to investigate how people interpret the term. The [World Bank[2]](http://gapm.io/xwb172) divides countries into income groups based on gross national income (GNI) per capita in current US $. According to the [World Bank[4]](http://gapm.io/xwb174), the low-income countries represent 9 percent of the world population, the middle-income countries, 76 percent of the world population, and the high-income countries, 16 percent of the world population, as follows:

-   Low income countries
    -   Less than $1,005 GNI per capita
    -   31 countries
    -   Total population: 0.7 billion people
-   Middle income countries
    -   $1,006 to $12,235 GNI per capita
    -   109 countries
    -   Total population: 5.6 billion people
-   High income countries
    -   $12,236 or more GNI per capita
    -   78 countries
    -   Total population: 1.2 billion people
