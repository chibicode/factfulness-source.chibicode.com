    Roadblocks seldom work to stop spreading an outbreak, as
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/ebola-learn-from-the-past-1.16117">
      David L. Heymann (2014) points out in Nature

     about his experiences of Ebola outbreaks in the past: &quot;Attempts to
    block the disease at Africa's porous borders did not stop past outbreaks,
    and will not work now. A cordon sanitaire was established by the DRC
    government around Kikwit in 1995 and enforced through military roadblocks.
    But contacts under fever surveillance travelled outside the cordon in dugout
    canoes. The military patrolled roads, but not forest paths leading to the
    Kwilu River.&quot;
