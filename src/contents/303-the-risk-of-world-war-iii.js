      Smil (2008), in Global Catastrophes and Trends: The Next Fifty Years, was
      already discussing ten years ago how six unfolding trends of the new world
      order were slowly leading to intensified conflicts between parts of the
      world: Europe's place, Japan's decline, Islam's choice, Russia's way,
      China's rise, and the United States' retreat.

      In Energy Transitions: Global and National Perspectives, Smil (2012)
      mentions three challenging identity shifts of the world order, which could
      lead to a third world war: first, Europe's place in the world; second,
      Japan's decline; and third, Islam's choice, Russians way, China's rise and
      the United States' retreat. All summarized in the chapter Dominance and
      Decline, in which these shifts require new identities. Most concerning are
      the huge disparities within China and the pride of Europe. Sweden has
      never been invaded by great Britain, but why not next? Only 35 years ago,
      the United Kingdom attacked the Falkland Island. If you read the book All
      the Countries We've Ever Invaded by Stuart Laycock (2012), it's easier to
      imagine that Europe might not be the victim of a third world war and more
      likely the perpetrator and a threat to world peace. See
