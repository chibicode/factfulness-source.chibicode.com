At present, the average white household in South Africa can spend roughly five times more money than the average black household. During apartheid in the 1970s, white people earned on average 12 times more than black people, according data from IRR. In the United States as of 2016, white households earned on average 1.6 times more than black households, $65,041 and $39,490 respectively; see US-CPS below.
