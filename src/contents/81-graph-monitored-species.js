    The IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) Red List[4] now
    includes an impressive 87,967 wildlife lk√∂lspecies (animals, fungi and
    plants), each with an expert assessments of threat-status. Out of these,
    25,062 (approximately 28%) today fall within one of the the three
    "threatened" categories: Critically Endangered (CR), Endangered (EN), or
    Vulnerable (VU). Despite the fact that the status of many of these species
    is not improving, we consider it a great improvement that they are at least
    monitored. Data after 2000 come from Red List[4]. The estimates for the
    following years are handpicked from the following publications and pages:
    1986, 1990 and 1996 come from previous paper editions of the list:

    . The first systematic approach to register and monitor threatened species
    was the 1959 "Threatened Mammals Card Index". It compiled data about 34
    mammal species and was managed by The Species Survival Commission under
    Leofric Boyle,
