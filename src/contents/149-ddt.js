      Paul Hermann Müller won the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1948
      for &quot;his discovery of the high efficiency of DDT as a contact poison
      against several arthropods.&quot; Hungary was the first country to ban
      DDT, in 1968, followed by Sweden in 1969. The United States banned it
      three years later; see CDC[2]. At the Stockholm Convention on Persistent
      Organic Pollutants (POPs) in 2004, the UN quickly helped to set up an
      international treaty against various pesticides, including DDT, which has
      entered into force in 158 countries; see 
      <a href="http://www.pops.int/">http://www.pops.int</a>.

      Since the 1970s, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and EPA
      (US Environmental Protection Agency) have issued directives on how to
      avoid the dangers of DDT to humans; see 
      <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=81&amp;tid=20">
        Toxicological profile for DDT, DDE and DDD
      </a>
       and the EPA <a href="http://gapm.io/xepa17">Pesticide information</a>.
      CDC correctly label direct DDT exposure to humans as unhealthy, but also
      state that the &quot;health effects from DDT at low environmental doses
      are unknown.&quot; Today, the World Health Organization promotes the use
      of DDT to save lives in poor settings by killing malaria mosquitoes,
      within strict safety guidelines: 
      <a href="http://gapm.io/xwhoddt1">
        &quot;The use of DDT in malaria vector control&quot;
      </a>
       and <a href="http://gapm.io/xwhoddt2">DDT in Indoor Residual Spraying</a>
       from WHO[6,7].
    </p>

      The CDC produced this 497 page document: 
      <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxprofiles/tp.asp?id=81&amp;tid=20">
        Toxicological profile for DDT, DDE and DDD
      </a>
      . We refer to the CDC as the source for the DDT report, even if it is
      signed by the 
      <a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/">
        Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
      </a>
       (ATSDR). ATSDR is a component of CDC's CIOs (Center, Institute, and
      Offices) and one of the CDC's independent expert groups within the U.S.
      Department of Health and Human Services; see the 
      <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/organization/cio.htm">
        CDC's organizational structure
