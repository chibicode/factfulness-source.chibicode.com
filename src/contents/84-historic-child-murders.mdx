All groups of hunter-gatherers and hunter-horticulturalists have not been equally brutal. At some archaeological sites, the violent death rates are lower than in most violent cities today, at 1%. But that is uncommon. Instead, violence among hunter-gatherers were probably at least 10 times more common. For 39 hunter-gatherers populations where archaeologists and anthropologists have assessed the causes of death, they have found flint arrowheads in chests and holes in skulls. And on average, the estimated murder rate for these sites was at 16%; see Pinker[3] and OurWorldInData[7]. Skeletons found in excavations of prehistoric massacres show that children were treated just as brutally as adults. Infanticide is found in many human groups with food scarcity across the world; see Pinker[4]. The hunter-gatherer groups studied by Gurven and Kaplan (2007) showed that deaths under age-15 were on average caused by violence.

In violent communities, children are not spared. Members of hunter-gatherer groups generally experienced lots of violence, as described in Gurven and Kaplan (2007), Diamond (2012), Pinker (2011), and [OurWorldInData[5]](https://www.ourworldindata.org/ethnographic-and-archaeological-evidence-on-violent-deaths). This doesn't mean all tribes of hunter-gatherers are the same. In situations of extreme poverty all across the world, many cultures have accepted the practice of infanticide, the killing of one's own children to reduce the number of mouths to feed in difficult times. This terrifying way of losing a child is just as painful as other ways, as consistently documented in traditional societies by anthropologists interviewing parents who had to kill a newborn---Pinker (2011, p. 417).
