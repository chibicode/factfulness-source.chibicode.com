Smallpox had been one of the major killers of humans. In 18th century Europe, for example, it caused [about 7% of all deaths](https://www.ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases/#smallpox), according to Max Roser (2018). Vaccines were [invented already in 1796](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/vaccines/en/), but not until 1980 was the nasty viruses defeated thanks to massive global vaccination campaigns lead by the World Health Organization. The last known case was recorded in [Somalia in 1977](http://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/). Smallpox was the first (and so far the only) disease eradicated by global vaccination programs. The graph shows the years when the last case was recorded in each country, based on data that was kindly shared with us by Katie Hampson, at Wellcome Trust Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem at University of Glasgow, Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences. The data was published in the paper [Towards the endgame and beyond: complexities and challenges for the elimination of infectious diseases](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/368/1623/20120137) by Klepac, et al (2013).
