The primary school completion rate for girls is below 35 percent in just three countries. But for all three, the uncertainty is high and the numbers are outdated: Afghanistan (1993), 15 percent; South Sudan (2011), 18 percent; Chad (2011), 30 percent. Three other countries---Somalia, Syria, and Libya---have no official number. The girls in these six countries suffer under severe gender inequality, but in total they make up only 2 percent of all girls of primary school age in the world. The data is based on UN-Pop[4], "Annual population by age---Female, medium fertility variant," available at [www.gapm.io/xpopage](http://www.gapm.io/xpopage). Note that in these countries, many boys are also missing school. See [gapm.io/twmedu](http://gapm.io/twmedu).
