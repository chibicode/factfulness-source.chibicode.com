Hans grew up in Uppsala, Sweden, in the working class slum suburb of Eriksberg, next to the Ekeby brick factory. The sewage problem in the early 1950s was just as bad as it is in industrial slums on level 2 across the world today. Not until the 1970s did this part of Uppsala get improved sanitation.
