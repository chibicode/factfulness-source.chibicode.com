These 14 graphs of differently shaped lines are all derived from plotting two indicators against each other and then drawing a line in the middle---just like the World Health Chart you see in the beginning of the book. We removed the background bubbles in the small images, because it got too cluttered. Most of these charts use national averages, aggregated by the national income level; see [Gapminder[3]](http://gapm.io/elev). A few (the straight line on recreational spending, the S-bend on vaccinations and fridges, and the slide on fertility) use household data. Our estimates of typical families on different income levels are not based on country averages, because that would severely underestimate the number of the poorest and mask the wide range of differences for countries on levels 1--3. Very few countries follow these lines exactly, but the lines show the general pattern of all countries over several decades. In each example, there are huge differences between countries on every level. You can explore the actual plotted bubbles behind these lines here: [www.gapm.io/flinex](http://www.gapm.io/flinex).
