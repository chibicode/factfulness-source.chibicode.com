      Professor Hossein Malek-Afzali at Tehran University of Medical Science was
      Hans's host in Iran, who showed him the infertility clinic and taught him
      about Iran's family planning and sexual education programs. We use the
      term &quot;babies per woman&quot; for the statistical indicator
      &quot;total fertility rate.&quot; In 1997, the full drop in fertility rate
      had not yet been achieved. Still, in the data that Hans had back then,
      Iran had the fastest drop. Today's UN data rather put Oman as the fastest
      with Gapminder data compared. (Except for Oman, depending on which years
      you compare, and how you deal with Gapminder's estimates of temporary
      dips. When removing those (by 5 year averages) the lead table looks like
      the following: Drop size within any time frame: Armenia: 4.06; Iran: 3.47;
      China: 3.46; Oman: 3.45; North Korea: 3.34; Russia: 3.11; Cuba: 2.45.

      These improvements in Iran, especially for women, also reflect
      achievements in regards to health and education. Women in Iran today have
      an average 10 years of school, compared to 2 years in 1970, according to
      HME[2]. During the same years, life expectancy increased from 56 years to
      76 during the same period, based on HME[2]. Comparing these numbers back
      then with Iran today, the differences are as wide as they probably could
      be. In Afghanistan, women today have 1 year of school, which is half of
      Iran's level in 1970. At present, Iran has a lower fertility rate than the
      US and Sweden. As of 2017, the total fertility rate is estimated to be at
      1.636 in Iran; 1.876 in the US; and 1.909 in Sweden, based on total
      fertility (TFR) data from UN's
      <a href="https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/">World Population Prospects 2017</a>
      .  To compare Iran---the world champion in family planning---against other
      countries over time, see
