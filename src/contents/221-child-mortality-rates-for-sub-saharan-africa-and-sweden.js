    See last two sheets &quot;speed of u5mr drop.xlsx&quot; The under-5
    mortality rates for all countries were turned into five year averages (pre
    1800, 10 year averages) to get rid of temporary enormous drops and data
    artefacts. We calculated all 57 year periods for all countries and SAA's
    countries dif during the period 1960--2017. This was compared with all
    Sweden's difs for all 57 years periods of Swedish history. Sweden was never
    reducing child deaths per 1000 faster than all the SAA countries during
    1960--2017. Counted in terms = (u5mr2017 -- u5mr1960). Sweden had a slow
    steady increase over 200 years, which SAA have achieved, with vaccines etc,
    in just 57 years.
