The examples of proportions that people tend to overestimate come from Ipsos MORI[2,3] and reveal misconceptions across 33 countries. The survey is called [Perils of Perception](http://www.gapm.io/xip15) (2015) and presents numbers like these highlights from the UK poll: For the wealth that the top 1 percent owns, the average guess was 59 percent, when the correct figure is 23 percent; on immigration, they guessed that 25 percent of the population are immigrants, when the the correct figure is 13 percent.

Innumeracy (1988) by John Allen Paulos is full of fascinating examples of disproportionality, asking, for example, how much the level of the Red Sea would rise if you added all the human blood in the world. See [www.gapm.io/fsize](http://www.gapm.io/fsize).
