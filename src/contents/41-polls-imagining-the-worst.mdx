Gapminder has asked the public in the United States and Sweden how they imagine life in "low-income countries" or "developing countries." They systematically guessed numbers that would have been correct 30 or 40 years ago. On average, respondents believed life expectancy is roughly 45 years, while [World Bank[7]](http://gapm.io/xwb177) says 62 years. They believed that roughly 20 percent of people in low-income countries have access to an improved water source---the correct number, according to [World Bank[8]](http://gapm.io/xwb178), is 66 percent. Further, they believed 40 percent of children are vaccinated---but data says 78 percent; see [World Bank[9]](http://gapm.io/xwb179) based on [WHO[1]](http://gapm.io/xwhoim). They believed roughly 70 percent are undernourished but it is only 26 percent; see [World Bank[10]](http://www.who.int/gho/tb/) based on [FAO[1]](http://gapm.io/faoh2006). All data from low-income countries have large uncertainties; still, the uncertainties are smaller than the public's misconceptions. See [www.gapm.io/rdev](http://www.gapm.io/rdev).
