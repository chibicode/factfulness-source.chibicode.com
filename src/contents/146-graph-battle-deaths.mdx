The data sources for battle deaths---[Correlates of War Project](http://www.correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/COW-war.), [Gleditsch](http://gapm.io/xnpgfred), [UCDP[1]](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads) and [PRIO](http://gapm.io/xpriod)---include reported deaths of civilians and soldiers during battle, but not indirect deaths like those from starvation. We strongly recommend watching this interactive data-driven documentary, which puts all known wars in perspective---at [www.fallen.io](http://www.fallen.io/). To interactively compare fatalities in wars since 1990, go to [http://ucdp.uu.se](http://ucdp.uu.se/). Measuring battle deaths is not trivial, as a war zone is no place for careful data collection. These studies publish numbers estimated by combining official sources and media reports from conflicts. But this method of estimating conflict fatalities has been disputed by several other researchers. Obermeyer and Murray showed in 2008 ([www.gapm.io/xobewar08](http://gapm.io/xobewar08)) that the number of battle deaths in recent wars seems much higher if estimated with a different method, based on sample surveys of the local population in war-torn areas, who report how many family members they lost in conflict, with the so called sibling method. These authors claim explicitly that "there's no evidence to support a recent decline in war deaths" since the Vietnam War. But the representativeness of the sample is not a trivial problem in these extreme events, and the number easily gets exaggerated when a local death toll is multiplied to a broader population. As there is little chance that new primary data will show up about past conflicts, the chances of new reliable estimates from other sources are small. The methodological discussion seems to have ended with a response in 2012 by Lacina & Gleditsch (see [www.gapm.io/xgledwar12](http://www.gapm.io/xgledwar12)), making the case that their data-sources are indeed bias in an unknown way and that the bias may not be the same over the decades. Maybe the tendency is to under-report in some wars in some decade and then over-report in others. But still, even if they take into account the experts highest levels of doubts and use the widest reasonable uncertainty estimates and they try their hardest to generate an increasing impression of fatalities, by drawing a trendline from the lowest estimates of past conflicts to the highest estimates of the recent conflicts, even such line would be steadily falling.
