This poll was initially conducted by YouGov. The results were so extraordinary that Gapminder decided to see if they could be replicated with a different polling company. In 2017, the same question was asked with Ipsos-MORI and the results were similar: This barchart mixes the results from the two online polls. [YouGov polled 18,000 people in 17 countries](http://www.gapm.io/xyougov15). The two countries where most people were [optimistic about the world](http://www.yougov.co.uk/news/2016/01/05/chinese-people-are-most-optimistic-word) were China and Indonesia in which 41% and 23% said the world is getting better. But we have decided to remove these two outliers because the proportion of people with access to the internet is not large enough to represent the whole population. It's quite likely that people with internet access have a different perception of the world than the rest of the population. This is not to discard the plausible and interesting hypothesis that Asians may be more positive than westerners. See [www.gapm.io/rbetter](http://www.gapm.io/rbetter).
