    During the past ten years, &quot;the external environment is volatile, with
    capital markets increasingly characterized by more extreme events&quot;,
    observe Dobbs et al. in No Ordinary Disruption (2016), illustrated by the
    peaks in the trend line on page 88. In his article &quot;How Should We
    Prevent the Next Financial Crisis?&quot; (2015) Ricardo Hausmann suggests
    that since the financial system constantly changes, it is difficult to learn
    from past mistakes---our next financial crisis will simply not look like any
    other that has happened before. Many countries have regulated their
    financial systems to prevent future crises by restricting loans and
    risk-taking. While this strategy is good for some countries, preventative
    measures do not benefit all. A number of countries in Latin America for
    example, Hausmann writes, have instead made their economies too secure. You
