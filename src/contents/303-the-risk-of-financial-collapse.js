    illustrated by the peaks in the trend line on page 88. In his article
    &quot;How Should We Prevent the Next Financial Crisis?&quot; (2015) Ricardo
    Hausmann suggests that since the financial system constantly changes, it is
    difficult to learn from past mistakes---our next financial crisis will
    simply not look like any other that has happened before. Many countries have
    regulated their financial systems to prevent future crises by restricting
    loans and risk-taking. While this strategy is good for some countries,
    preventative measures do not benefit all. A number of countries in Latin
    America for example, Hausmann writes, have instead made their economies too
    secure. You can read the article by Hausmann in full at
