The X-ray was taken by Staffan Bremmer at Sophiahemmet in Stockholm. The sword swallower is a friend of Hans's, called Maryanne Magdalen. Her website is here:Â [www.gapm.io/xsword](http://www.gapm.io/xsword). The original image that Hans saw was of Hjalmar Wickman, who later inspired Hans and taught him the art of sword swallowing.
